"Very good location
Nice and friendly people
Friendly staff
I stayed just one night but it was very nice place and I met some great people there. The hostel is well equipped also if you want to cook for yourself.

Room very clean,POSITIVE

Number 31 was a wonderful stay! We loved the room decor and spacious footprint. The bed was so comfortable and no noise from outdoors or from the adjoining dining area. The Staff were friendly and helped us obtain a cab to the airport & holding our bags for the day while we wandered through Dublin.,POSITIVE
not sure about the bed but changed the direction of pillow and excellent nights sleep,NEGATIVE
Nothing! it was perfect.,POSITIVE
"What didn't we like?! The accommodations were absolutely stunning in the Georgian house which had such a fun and vibrant ascetic. Our bathroom was fitted with stunning (perhaps even heated?) marble with a lovely shower, which opened up to a double bedroom with a glorious floor to ceiling window, a generously sized plush bed, and a huge mounted tv to boot! The location was perfectly situated around incredible restaurants and a very navigable bus route to get just about anywhere in Dublin in under 25 min, not to mention Delia's phenomenal daily breakfast! Our last day of our stay she was even kind enough to leave us with an early pot of coffee, fruit, and bread after calling us a taxi to the airport.  We had a wonderful time staying at Number 31 and felt it was really competitively priced. Would definitely recommend and hope to return someday!",POSITIVE

"The manager in the breakfast restaurant on 28 and 29 January (Saturday and Sunday) was clearly less professional, less attentive, less helpful, than her colleagues, who were on duty on the other days. The bar is set high in Merrion, and she is just not the right fit for the job.",NEGATIVE
outstanding in every respect,POSITIVE
the prices.,POSITIVE
"The place, the welcome, the service, the food are all great.",POSITIVE
Only minor things really. Gym is small and classes running there so it was too busy to use when I visited. Lights in room were strong and no dimmers or separate switch to turn some on/off.

"Perfect location, had all the facilities we needed, Tesco opposite was ideal, comfy beds and they put together a little birthday surprise in the room for us which was lovely",POSITIVE
We didn’t mind this as we knew we were on a Main Street but it is loud until around 2am on the weekend. We were at the front of the hotel so it was louder so if you’re bothered about noise then ask to be in a back room.,NEGATIVE
I chose this hotel for its proximity to where I was working but also because of its location amidst the pubs and restaurants for which the Temple Bar area is famous.,POSITIVE
"I chose a room with two double beds as I was sharing with a friend.  It did not have the city view as advertised but, maybe because of that, it was very quiet and we did get a very good night's sleep.  The beds were also very comfortable.  There was no fridge and there was only one bed-side light in between the two double beds.  One bedside light on either side of the beds would have been better so that one person can read if the other wants to go to sleep.   This room would not win any prizes for interior design but it was clean and comfortable and the location was excellent.",POSITIVE
"Nice hotel 
Clean 
Central location 
Friendly staff",POSITIVE
"There was a strange damp smell in the hallways, which was awful.  
Check in and check out was a little all over the place
Last time i stayed here there was a little welcome treat bag in the room which there wasn't this time. Disappointed as had brought older family members who would have enjoyed it",NEGATIVE
the lay out of the bedrooms was excellent and a little light crept under the door enough to see your way to the loo in the night without putting a main light on and wakening your partner the breakfast was good and hearty and the waiters were attentive and anything requested came quickly,POSITIVE
The room was huge - could have had a party in there. Location is perfect and staff very friendly and helpful.,POSITIVE
"I stayed in this hotel regularly many years ago and despite renovations, the decor is not as nice or comfortable as it was then. I found the room cold.",NEGATIVE
"We stayed at Sonder for 2 weeks while working from home and quarantining. The apartments are truly excellent - modern, clean, spacious and in a really great location on Hannover Quay. The staff at Sonder were so helpful with any requests. Would highly recommend for any stay in Dublin.",POSITIVE
"Location is really cool
The apartment is perfect.all facilities are included",POSITIVE
Address instruction needs to be written more in details.,NEGATIVE
Good location and new building fully set up to live in for two weeks.,POSITIVE
We had some hiccups with the internet at first.,NEGATIVE
Everything,POSITIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
The apartment was nice,POSITIVE
The black and white puddings at breakfast were over done and hard and should have all been put in the bin along with the Toaster which cremates the crust whilst the centre is hardly coloured Plus I was not told until the last day that if I only wanted tea and toast I could down grade the cost from full Irish to continental,NEGATIVE
"The heating was not working properly and we were cold it was not fixed despite many requests. They offered us heaters and extra blankets but this was not adequate. It is not want one expects when paying 1,500 Euro per week.",NEGATIVE
"There was a drainpipe right outside the window. When it rains the noise is unbearable and one can't sleep On four occasions I had to sleep in the living room. I had to take the cushions from the sofa and put them near the door as this was the only darkish spot. Could not sleep on the couch as there are only net curtains and too much light gets in even at night, street lights etc.When the extractor fan over the cooker is turned on, dirt covers the food that you are preparing. Looks something like sawdust.Extractor fans in the bathroom did not work nor did the towel railThe heating system has a mind of its own. Had to call a technician in to the set it up right. He advised that it was all set up wrong. And even after he fixed it/set up the controls right, the heating was still all over the place e.g. you set the heat for 21degrees it still wouldn't raise above 19.If I wasn't to busy I would have moved elsewhere. The place is not fit for purpose.But if you like your food covered in sawdust, sleepless nights and erratic room temperatures, then this is the place for you.",NEGATIVE

"Outstanding facility with state-of-the-art architecture, staff, and the perfect location for everyone who wants to explore the city centre.The room was tiny for the Dublin average, but it had everything needed, controllable with the tip of your finger.Spotless doesn't do justice to how clean, and immaculate the whole place was, from the entrance, the bar, and the room.",POSITIVE
"No complaints, just maybe one or two breakfast ingredients were not at the same standard as everything else.But I wouldn't put this in the cons section :)",POSITIVE

The bed is difficult for two people as up against the window and you have to climb over each other,NEGATIVE

The room was clean and the cleaning service was great. Came back to a clean room every day. 
Also the shower was great! Located in an Ok area. Dublin is we’ll connected which is helpful",POSITIVE
The rooms were a lot more basic than in pictures. almost all of the staff were helpful except one who kept taking personal calls at reception and passed us on to other members of staff who couldn’t help. I think it is slightly overpriced. Not the best area. didn’t sleep great. Bed was uncomfortable,NEGATIVE
location was excellent,POSITIVE
Breakfast was excellent as always location not to far from train station no complaints,POSITIVE
The rooms are adequately spacious. The pub area is nice. The staff are friendly.,POSITIVE

Good location for shopping and eating out. Not too much of a walk from Temple bar either. Room was clean,POSITIVE

"Cafe is basically the reception, shuts at 5pm, so need to make special arrangement if checking in after that. informed that via booking.com messages, but still seems a little restrictive. If locked out, could be awkward. But basically same as Airbnb, so if you’re careful you’re ok.",NEGATIVE

"The staff on the front desk weren’t very welcoming when we arrived at the hotel. The room had been prepaid for as an Xmas present for my partner but the desk staff opened with asking me to pay the full amount again. which was a bit embarrassing as he was standing there. 
Although the room is as advertised as Small, it is Very Small for £200+ a night. and no bath.",NEGATIVE

"The loveliest, smiliest, staff throughout who went out of their way to help.  Hotel is in a fantastic central location but still in a calm, quiet street.  Room was nice and spacious with a big bed and a sofa.  Breakfast was delicious with more than enough great food to keep you going.",POSITIVE
"The bed was big with a good, firm mattress (two singles pushed together) but was in desperate need of a mattress topper as it was just too hard.  Bath towels were tiny and only just big enough for a child.   We paid a promotional price for the room but would have been very disappointed if we had paid the full price.",NEGATIVE
Breakfast,POSITIVE
Having to book this when we did not know.,POSITIVE
"Elegant hotel, beautifully appointed with attentive staff. Location was great especially good food at the adjacent Dunne & Crescenzi restaurant",POSITIVE
"Had a cosy standard room at the top of the house. It was small but very well laid out with plenty of storage for a short stay, and decorated beautifully. As it is an old townhouse there are no lifts in the building, so perhaps request a lower floor room if three flights of stairs sound alot.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fabulous in a modern restaurant at the back of the building. The location was excellent - close to shopping, restaurants, and travel links. And despite its central location it is on a quiet street.",POSITIVE

The bed was comfortable and the amenities in the kitchen were great, the apartment had everything you needed.",POSITIVE
"It was a little further from the city centre than we expected but still not too long to walk. And public transport nearby. We had the basement room which i would have preferred not to have but was ok. However there was a lot of rubbish outside the room window, with an exit that you couldn't use. Not the most practical if you dont like stairs as we had to go up and then back down to get into our apartment in the adjacent building.",NEGATIVE
Clean and comfortable.,POSITIVE
Friendly staff. Good facilities. Spacious room.,POSITIVE
"Noisy basement room, when paid extra for quiet larger room. Bathroom was dated.",NEGATIVE

The flush in the toilet was rather weak; the position of the safe in the wardrobe meant that you couldn't hang things properly; can someone tell me which is the shower gel - body cream or body lotion...?!All in all I would really recommend this place and stay again...,NEGATIVE
it was such a nice building and very clean,POSITIVE

The hotel and check in itself was lovely and easy. We had arrived early and the hotel did everything that could to ensure that we could get in as early as possible. The room was tidy and clean,POSITIVE
The walls of the hotel are very thin! this is the only downfall. You can hear everything through the walls especially the cleaners. It isn't a big let down but just something we noticed.,NEGATIVE
Location was good.,POSITIVE
The check in…Was told our room wasn’t going to be ready until 4pm. The boy at the desk did not seem phased at all as we had reservations at 4pm. He finally changed our room so we could get in earlier (3:30pm).,NEGATIVE
Location is excellent,POSITIVE

"Room size for a family of 4 adults.  Facilities in room. Kitchen, nice shower, tv with Netflix nice touch. Plenty of sockets. Fans provided.",POSITIVE
Only a small detail but would have preferred an actual toaster as the grill in the microwave took ages.  Also the lounge was brilliant but only had actual settee and 1 chair for 3 and we were 4 adults so needs an extra seat as plenty of room.  There was a balcony but no key so couldn’t use.,NEGATIVE
"Easy to find & good location! The staff were lovely, the Manager recommended loads of places for us & told us to come to them with any questions. They were really friendly & helped us out with any issues. Had an amazing time in the pub below with live music, was sooo much fun!

Tennis courts are brilliant and space outside is brilliant",POSITIVE
Weather ðŸ™ˆ,NEGATIVE
"The Nook was exactly the place we were looking for on our family trip to Dublin!  Daniel's place was spacious, clean, well-stocked, safe, and quiet (private gated parking was a plus).  Communication was excellent (quick, friendly, and detailed) and check in/out was simple.  It was nice to spread out and relax after spending all day running around in the city.  Access to the washer and dryer was perfect (needed some clean clothes after 16 days on the road).  We would definitely stay here again when traveling to Dublin in the future!",POSITIVE

Bedrooms that are just massive and spacious. We really enjoyed our stay and the upper landing room with the additional tv meant our children had their own space. Will be definitely booking again when we visit Ireland again!!",POSITIVE

The location is spot on! my wifey and I loved it as we could move around easily, restaurants, coffee shops, supermarkets all in walking distance.",POSITIVE
"The view in our room (605) wasn’t what I expected as being HH Gold member although I did not say anything on my arrival. Also, one very important thing I requested over the phone days prior our arrival was foam pillows and not feather due to my wife’s asthma issues but unfortunately we had feather pillows in our room anyway. I know Miguel gave us an upgrade or room move upon check-in which we were thankful for so it could have been the case why it was forgotten. We didn’t notice this earlier because went to the room just for a refresher then went out as we had dinner reservation and came back late. 
During our sleep my wife started coughing now and then but she managed as she had her puff. 
After breakfast I mentioned this to reception and they changed the pillows later.
We had a great stay and like I said your staff is superb but remember that the attention to details it’s what makes the difference. Thank you!",NEGATIVE
I couldn't fault this hotel.  Location was great. Room was super comfortable.,POSITIVE
"The lovely bar finished at 11pm, which was a shame.",POSITIVE
"All the staff were lovely. Steve in the bar deserves a special mention as my husband lamented the lack of Carlsberg in Lemuels bar, he only wanted one before our dinner. Steve went downstairs and got him a pint which was really appreciated. Its in a great location close to Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Our room was gorgeous, with a huge comfy bed",POSITIVE
"The added cost of breakfast. I feel its particularly disingenuous of hotels to charge an extra E50 on top of an already eyewatering price to stay overnight. The breakfast was fine, but we had fruit, followed by poached eggs on one slice of toast. Its an extortionate price, plus we were left a form to sign for it (never saw that before) and there was a space for a gratuity!",NEGATIVE
very pleasant overall,POSITIVE

"The location was in a very safe neighbourhood, and as a female solo traveller I really appreciated this. There was a bus stop right outside the lodge, and the DART trains were about a 10 minute walk. The Dublin Bay was a 7 minute walk away and was absolutely beautiful. The owners were so helpful, extremely nice, and very knowledgeable about things to do in the area. The room was serviced everyday and was very clean, the shower pressure was fantastic and the bed was very comfortable. I would absolutely stay again.",POSITIVE
"I had such a lovely stay at the beautiful and charming Aberdeen Lodge. Ann & Pat were so friendly and welcoming - Ann greeted me with tea and homebaked cookies, and she gave me the best! sightseeing tips perfectly fitted for my personality and preferences. She had Enya on her playlist during breakfast hours at the restaurant - I loved that! and the home-cooked breakfast was amazing!! I would come back anytime to enjoy the gorgeous quiet classy surroundings, the nice neighborhood with great public transportation and the warm hospitality - hopefully soon!",POSITIVE

We hope to see you again in the beautiful Dublin soon!",POSITIVE

Super helpful and friendly staff, and the family who run the lodge are gracious and also helpful. I felt very at home in my cozy room and with the resident pets, Robin, Sandy, and Coco.",POSITIVE
"Our hosts were helpful, friendly and exceptionally nice!  Breakfasts were fabulous.  The owners gave us helpful suggestions on how to tour the city. We got necessary wake up calls and they called taxis for us as needed.  The two golden retriever ""greeters"" were sweet friendly dogs and we posted their photos on Facebook.  I'd recommend this nice B&B to anyone visiting Dublin.  Sincerely,Mike & Nancy Branigan",POSITIVE
"Everything was perfect , the best breakfast i have ever had.",POSITIVE
nothing,NEGATIVE
Location just outside the city.  Parking on site.  Great staff and wonderful breakfast.  Warm welcome.  Loved petting the goldens!,POSITIVE
"Only negative if I had to say would be the bathroom needs a little attention around the tub molding.  Not a deal breaker as everyone deals with keeping caulking white.  Bathroom was very clean.  Another concern as with other places we have stayed, was hot and cold water pours into sink or tub separately.  Quick fix was to draw the bath prior to entering tub to avoid risk for scalding from hot water spout.  Note this is not a complaint, merely a caution as we found very common in Ireland.   
Note:  Would not recommend for persons with mobility issues due to need to climb multiple stairs.",NEGATIVE

Bathroom,POSITIVE
bed -uncomfortable,NEGATIVE
"An outstanding location in the heart of the city.  A super-friendly staff.  And who wouldn't want a comfy room right above one of the best pubs around.  So much character and a fun place to stay.  Our room was on the top floor, which meant 54 narrow and winding steps, but that just added to the charm.  Already planning a return visit.",POSITIVE
Good location and place to stay,POSITIVE
It was all good,POSITIVE
the staff where probably the best I’ve ever had..... pub underneath was insane.,NEGATIVE

the history and the atmosphere,POSITIVE
"The location was perfect, the staff were brilliant - really friendly, easy check in and room service was an added bonus as well!",POSITIVE
We didn't like that our trip had to end...honestly cannot fault O'Donoghues at all - already planning our next trip back!,NEGATIVE
"Check-in in the pub downstairs was smooth - even got my suitcase carried to the top floor (no lift). Expected it to be noisy on top of a pub, but it was very quiet.",POSITIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
Great stay at O’Donoghue’s. Fantastic location in Dublin for a really central stay. No issues whatsoever and everything was really clean! We were also pleasantly surprised to find two extra single beds in our double room so had plenty of space which was great. The room itself was a bit out dated in terms of decor but is in keeping with the pub. Bathroom seemed to be new and much more modern and had clearly been redone more recently. Really recommend this place and would definitely stay here again!,POSITIVE
nothing,NEGATIVE
"Great staff, comfy rooms, good facilities, and the location is excellent for the price",POSITIVE
"Loved that it was above the pub, the rooms were spacious and clean, but felt cosy.",POSITIVE

good breakfast and great location,POSITIVE
bit noisy from bar underneath,NEGATIVE
Beds where comfy,POSITIVE
I lost my ID and debt card and I thought we where going to be bedless for the night as yee didn't accept cash apparently  it doesn't say on your website that you didn't . Lucky my friend had the funds on his card other wise we would have no where to stay ..,NEGATIVE
The hot tap in the sink has to run a very long time to get hot water (Room 548),NEGATIVE
The 3am fire alarm on our last night after a long weekend of racing was very unpleasant!,NEGATIVE
shower not working properly / water pressure.,NEGATIVE
Great location- walking distance to city centre/RDS/Aviva. On a busy road but very quiet room,POSITIVE
Lack of parking- parked on Waterloo Rd and got clamped- bus lanes very unclear! Comfortable bedroom but obvious wear and tear,NEGATIVE
The room was clean and the bed was comfy.,POSITIVE
"The staff were not the warmest. We arrived an hour early, which we were aware check in was not until 2 but we wanted to leave in our bags. The man on reception spoke to us rather rudely and did not appear to want to give us the time of day. We are a young couple, and I believe that this possibly may have been the reason we were not treated in the same way as other couples might. There was no “welcome to Lansdowne hotel, enjoy your stay”. Instead, our initial ‘welcome’ included an irritated look on this member of staff’s face and a sneer as he informed us “lads you’re too early for check-in, we’ve to sort out other people first”. Let me reiterate how we had been aware of this matter, and all we were looking for was a simple hello and perhaps even a smile.",NEGATIVE
"Staff, location on point",POSITIVE
the double bed was not acknowledged,NEGATIVE
the property is in a great location with friendly staff and a homely feeling.,POSITIVE
Close to bus stop when going into town. Staff very friendly,POSITIVE

Gorgeous home! This accommodation served our family of 5 very well. Easy drive into Dublin and close to grocery store - convenient. Property was beautiful.,POSITIVE
"Loved the closeness to city centre whilst feeling miles away. Privacy was great and the facilities were top class. We had bad weather but will return again as facilities are amazing. Management replied to any query within minutes and were more than accommodating with cots and stair gates.
Tennis courts are brilliant and space outside is brilliant",POSITIVE
Weather ðŸ™ˆ,NEGATIVE
"The Nook was exactly the place we were looking for on our family trip to Dublin!  Daniel's place was spacious, clean, well-stocked, safe, and quiet (private gated parking was a plus).  Communication was excellent (quick, friendly, and detailed) and check in/out was simple.  It was nice to spread out and relax after spending all day running around in the city.  Access to the washer and dryer was perfect (needed some clean clothes after 16 days on the road).  We would definitely stay here again when traveling to Dublin in the future!",POSITIVE
"It was 25 - 30 minutes from Dublin city center, but we knew that when we booked it.  The drive time was well worth it for the peace and quiet of this beautiful home.",POSITIVE
"Clean, quiet, great location south of city center, safe, just an overall great stay.   laundry facilities were a great bonus for us!  Daniel was very helpful and always available when needed(even at 1am!).  ðŸ˜Š",POSITIVE

Nothing at all,NEGATIVE
lovely location and peaceful. We were kept fully informed from the start.,POSITIVE
"The area around the house is gorgeous and serene. A shirt drive from Dublin, you get some space from the hustle of the city. If you're willing,  you can walk about and see some of the local spots for a cizy meal.",POSITIVE
"The only inconvenience I encountered was that one of the rooms didn't have any means to store clothing. Wasn't the end of the works,  but was unfirtunate as the other rooms did.",NEGATIVE
"Great communication from the host. Spacious, comfortable bedrooms and well equipped kitchen. Easy to get to from Dublin airport and beautiful location close to tourist attractions.",POSITIVE
The lounge area downstairs was small.,NEGATIVE
"We booked for a family visit. Well what can I say, a peaceful quiet location yet so accessible to everywhere we needed. The place is approached by an impressive gated drive. Bedrooms that are just massive and spacious. We really enjoyed our stay and the upper landing room with the additional tv meant our children had their own space. Will be definitely booking again when we visit Ireland again!!",POSITIVE
Wished we had booked longer. Really loved the place.,POSITIVE
"Fab boutique hotel, 20 mins walk from Grafton Street. The bar was great for drinks, staff super friendly. Hotel manager during the day was amazing! nothing would slip by her.",POSITIVE
parking is on the street! the only downside,POSITIVE

"It was perfect.
Vicky, Kayla and Alfie, thank you for you smile.",POSITIVE
the rooms in the newer section don’t seem as fresh as the ones in the original part. might have just mine but felt as it needed a little re-fresh,NEGATIVE
Patrick the Manager was so welcoming and accommodating he was a wealth of knowledge on the area,POSITIVE
I would have preferred to stay in the newer part of hotel,NEGATIVE
"The team could not do enough to make our visit special. It was my 40th and between a selection of cakes in the room on arrival to more after dining, and a small token for the children (they were at home with their grandparents), they thought of everything. Thank you to you all.",POSITIVE
Staff are very goodBreakfast top class,POSITIVE
Our room had two lights not working and the cold water mixer in the bathroom did not work well. It took 5 mins for cold water to mix.,NEGATIVE
nice old building with comfortable room,POSITIVE
the decor was looking rather tired and the location was a bit out of the way,NEGATIVE
The staff could not have been more helpful. They really made the difference to the stay at the Dylan.,POSITIVE

Bathroom not cleaned to good standard. Felt overpriced for hotel not in centre of city.,NEGATIVE
Spotless stay. All perfect. Good parking garage,POSITIVE
"The staff were superb! Special mention to Miguel, Sarah, Gema (I think) from Argentina, Luisa for Colombia, Joy the Asian fellow and the rest, thank you for looking after us. 
The location is spot on! my wifey and I loved it as we could move around easily, restaurants, coffee shops, supermarkets all in walking distance.",POSITIVE
"The view in our room (605) wasn’t what I expected as being HH Gold member although I did not say anything on my arrival. Also, one very important thing I requested over the phone days prior our arrival was foam pillows and not feather due to my wife’s asthma issues but unfortunately we had feather pillows in our room anyway. I know Miguel gave us an upgrade or room move upon check-in which we were thankful for so it could have been the case why it was forgotten. We didn’t notice this earlier because went to the room just for a refresher then went out as we had dinner reservation and came back late. 
During our sleep my wife started coughing now and then but she managed as she had her puff. 
After breakfast I mentioned this to reception and they changed the pillows later.
We had a great stay and like I said your staff is superb but remember that the attention to details it’s what makes the difference. Thank you!",NEGATIVE
I couldn't fault this hotel.  Location was great. Room was super comfortable.,POSITIVE
"The lovely bar finished at 11pm, which was a shame.",POSITIVE
"All the staff were lovely. Steve in the bar deserves a special mention as my husband lamented the lack of Carlsberg in Lemuels bar, he only wanted one before our dinner. Steve went downstairs and got him a pint which was really appreciated. Its in a great location close to Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Our room was gorgeous, with a huge comfy bed",POSITIVE
"The room was lovely, spacious and modern. The bed was very comfortable. Staff were lovely and the reception area had lots of space to sit and relax.",POSITIVE
"The added cost of breakfast. I feel its particularly disingenuous of hotels to charge an extra E50 on top of an already eyewatering price to stay overnight. The breakfast was fine, but we had fruit, followed by poached eggs on one slice of toast. Its an extortionate price, plus we were left a form to sign for it (never saw that before) and there was a space for a gratuity!",NEGATIVE
very pleasant overall,POSITIVE
"amazing service,five star service",POSITIVE
"Customer services including reception
Dog friendly hotel
Good location within walking distance of Grafton st etc & nearby estaurants
Quietness of room",POSITIVE

I really enjoyed myself!,POSITIVE
"spacious rooms, great breakfast selections, over the top service from EVERYONE",POSITIVE
"There was hair in the shower, greasy finger marks on the side of the kitchen and what looked like tomato sauce down the side of the sofa bed.",NEGATIVE

"Very clean and spacious room, great neighbourhood away from the city fuss, friendly staff",POSITIVE
The rooms are nice an clean. Great Breakfast.,POSITIVE

"At 2am, I was awakened by people talking and laughing very loudly in what seemed to be the adjancent rooms. 
Unfortunately, breakfast wasn't great. Bacon was way too salty, and the puddings were not great quality and not done enough. The little tap on the orange juice jar didn't work...",NEGATIVE

Second time to stay at Gleesons.Have booked to stay again.,POSITIVE
Everything was lovely,POSITIVE
"The location was in a very safe neighbourhood, and as a female solo traveller I really appreciated this. There was a bus stop right outside the lodge, and the DART trains were about a 10 minute walk. The Dublin Bay was a 7 minute walk away and was absolutely beautiful. The owners were so helpful, extremely nice, and very knowledgeable about things to do in the area. The room was serviced everyday and was very clean, the shower pressure was fantastic and the bed was very comfortable. I would absolutely stay again.",POSITIVE
"I had such a lovely stay at the beautiful and charming Aberdeen Lodge. Ann & Pat were so friendly and welcoming - Ann greeted me with tea and homebaked cookies, and she gave me the best! sightseeing tips perfectly fitted for my personality and preferences. She had Enya on her playlist during breakfast hours at the restaurant - I loved that! and the home-cooked breakfast was amazing!! I would come back anytime to enjoy the gorgeous quiet classy surroundings, the nice neighborhood with great public transportation and the warm hospitality - hopefully soon!",POSITIVE
"Welcoming with warm drink made us feel very welcome. Fulfilling breakfast with exceptional variations. Also, very friendly service.",POSITIVE
I didn't care that windows can't be open. It was a downside.,NEGATIVE
Room was a bit cold for our likening. There was no toilet brush.,NEGATIVE
"Homely, welcoming feel & I loved the fresh lilies!",POSITIVE
I would prefer more eco-friendly products & fresh milk in a small jug as opposed to plastic pots. Reduce waste.,NEGATIVE
The Aberdeen Lodge was perfectly located close to the Dart to easily access Dublin and other nearby neighborhoods.,POSITIVE
"Nothing, Ann and Pat were lovely and I adored my stay here.",NEGATIVE
"Aberdeen Lodge is a charming place in the beautiful residential area of Sandymouth very close and very well connected to downtown. The environment, familiar and full of charm, offers all the services for a wonderful stay, including a truly unmissable à la carte breakfast. The rooms are super comfortable and cosy and the staff are really nice and helpful. Special thanks to Pat for his support and really invaluable help. We hope to see you again in the beautiful Dublin soon!",POSITIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
"A beautiful property in a lovely borough of Dublin. The furnishings are comfortable and fit the character of the property. Breakfasts are exceptional. Super helpful and friendly staff, and the family who run the lodge are gracious and also helpful. I felt very at home in my cozy room and with the resident pets, Robin, Sandy, and Coco.",POSITIVE
"Our hosts were helpful, friendly and exceptionally nice!  Breakfasts were fabulous.  The owners gave us helpful suggestions on how to tour the city. We got necessary wake up calls and they called taxis for us as needed.  The two golden retriever ""greeters"" were sweet friendly dogs and we posted their photos on Facebook.  I'd recommend this nice B&B to anyone visiting Dublin.  Sincerely,Mike & Nancy Branigan",POSITIVE
"Everything was perfect , the best breakfast i have ever had.",POSITIVE
everything was great,POSITIVE
nothing,NEGATIVE
Location just outside the city.  Parking on site.  Great staff and wonderful breakfast.  Warm welcome.  Loved petting the goldens!,POSITIVE
"Only negative if I had to say would be the bathroom needs a little attention around the tub molding.  Not a deal breaker as everyone deals with keeping caulking white.  Bathroom was very clean.  Another concern as with other places we have stayed, was hot and cold water pours into sink or tub separately.  Quick fix was to draw the bath prior to entering tub to avoid risk for scalding from hot water spout.  Note this is not a complaint, merely a caution as we found very common in Ireland.   
Note:  Would not recommend for persons with mobility issues due to need to climb multiple stairs.",NEGATIVE
"The hotel itself was extremely comfortable, the rooms were lovely and spacious. the staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful. thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Breakfast was wonderful.",POSITIVE

Great hotel - Perfect location and accomodation.Excellent Reception staff at the door and the front deskVery friendly and welcoming staff at the Atrium - lovely location,POSITIVE
"For a five star hotel breakfast was poor !The food was not hot and the coffee was incredibly diluted and substandard.The seating arrangements were too narrow and guests kept knocking tables spilling milk, etc.The lady seating guests at breakfast was not very welcoming and lacked patience in contrast to all other staff",NEGATIVE
The staff at reception couldn't be nicer. Sofia got us early checking for our triple room which was lovely. Very spacious. On our return that evening after attending a show Jesus very kindly upgraded our double to a fabulous newly renovated room!! Thank you Jesus!!Breakfast was really great with everything for everyone and lovely staff who went out of their way to puree porridge for one of us with a health problem.,POSITIVE

Comfortable rooms. Good housekeeping and maintenance . Very friendly staff particularly front desk staff,POSITIVE
"The location of the property is fantastic, right in the thick of it, and perfect for exploring all that Dublin has to offer. The price was also fairly reasonable. One half of the building (where Reception is located) is really beautiful, and a nice place to grab a drink and a bite to eat.",POSITIVE
breakfast is ordinary and can be better for a luxury chain,NEGATIVE
friendly and professional staff. spacious and well appointed bedroom. great bar,POSITIVE
gym could do with a bench press and ladies sauna could do with a bit of repair to the upper bench.,NEGATIVE
"Resignation, pocket and happiness were all good and wonderful",POSITIVE

Found our room cold,NEGATIVE
"The staff was very engaged. Everyone from the reception to the restaurant and the floor attendants was very friendly. I had indicated during the booking that it was our anniversary, so they left chocolates in the room for us, and we were very happy. Restaurant food was amazing. I would love to go again.",POSITIVE
"The only problem was that the room was so hot, we couldn't control the temperature. The bed was very comfortable but the sheets were burning. In general, everything was very good.",POSITIVE
"everything was very modern and new.  rooms very secure.  robbery of rooms nearly impossible. i had a comfy en suite single and paid only $75 per nite.  cheap by dublin standards.  while most of the clientele are young, nights were very quiet.  its not in the city center but walking not too far or can use the frequent bus service with stops 3 minutes walk away.  the communal kitchens were pretty well equipped to cook simple meals or use microwave for frozen meals.  super market and convenience stores only 5 minute walk. had large fridge.  kitchen was always spotless.   nice gastropub adjacent to property.",POSITIVE
there was a lot of new highrise construction in the area.  so location not quaint.,NEGATIVE
"The layout of the hotel is a little odd. There is one really lovely half and one NOT so lovely half. Unfortunately, our room was at the very bottom of the not so lovely half. The room itself was okay, although the toilet struggled to flush and the shower bowl filled up with water quickly. We completely understand that the hotel bar gets busy at night, and to be honest we weren't really bothered by that, especially given the hotel's advance warning and other reviews. BUT the noise of doors clanging and footsteps above us both kept us up at night and woke us up in the morning, and that really wasn't acceptable.",NEGATIVE
"Good location, good staff, room is clean and have some good restaurant nearby",POSITIVE
"washing machine is hard to use, and I lost my two coats:(",NEGATIVE
"Stayed here twice, each time had different issues..Blinds broken, bed broken, shower not working,...I get that it is student accommodation..",NEGATIVE

"Affordable , good location",POSITIVE
Bed wasn't a standard double bed,NEGATIVE

"It was quite and peaceful, comfortable bed and very nice and spacious .",POSITIVE
"The fridge had a very unpleasant smell, we didn’t end up using it .",NEGATIVE
"I loved the location. Really safe and cool neighborhood. It's also a short walk to the center of the city.  I stayed here to attend an event at Trinity College Dublin, and I adored the walk to Trinity. Lovely cafes along the way. Very walkable location. I really liked the courtyard.",POSITIVE
"The kitchen lacked some materials to make cooking convenient. Some facilities, like the kitchen and other (indoor) common areas were a little dirty. Our shower had a little mold, too. Nothing that was a deal breaker. I look back on my 2-week stay at Destiny Student - New Mill with fond memories.",NEGATIVE
Friendly and helpful staff,POSITIVE
"It was quite far from the city centre

bed is a little too small for couples,NEGATIVE
Location,POSITIVE
"We got only one room key fob which was a problem as we had a baby with us and I’d need to go to the room before my partner. When we asked about it at reception they said they can’t program another key, that the owner doesn’t want to spend money on it as it’s a single student room during the academic year. The thing is they charge over 200€ per night so for that price we should be getting what we paid for. There is one kitchen for 4 rooms but only 2 cups, 2 plates and two spoons, forks, etc, ridiculous. We chose this place because it said it has fully equipped kitchen (we needed some stuff for the baby) but kitchen was barely empty and there was no soap to wash the dishes.",NEGATIVE
"clean, not many amenities, small bed , basic, but that what is advertised as student so you get what you pay It seemed expensive but Dublin hotel prices at the time were way higher so in that sense good value",POSITIVE
room a little small,NEGATIVE
"Able to walk to St Patrick’s, Trinity College, pubs, shopping, St Stephens Green, and more!",POSITIVE

"Towels had to be Rented
No Travel Supplies in rooms, toothpaste etc,",NEGATIVE
"The room was clean and everything was functional and useful. The room is a standard student accommodation, not too big, but good enough for 2 people for one or 2 nights. Dublin is not that big and from the city centres you could walk for 15 minutes to the accommodation.",POSITIVE
"Unfortunately the prices are ridiculous in Dublin regarding the accommodation, but the check-in and check-out hours are unpleasant for this accommodation in particular. If you do such a late check-in, the check-out should be at least 11pm. Unfortunately you also have to pay 5 euro for luggage storage, for a few hours.",NEGATIVE
rooms clean and tidy and nice modern Decor and complimentary tea and coffee which was a nice touch,POSITIVE
"the noise on the street was VERY loud and i couldnt sleep either night , when you do drop off people are up and slamming the doors really early the doors are really loud when they close i had a complete lack of sleep which was impacting the fun i could have around dublin £20 deposit o my my card for a minature fan the beds are really small as a double this is explained but combined with heat and very noisy rooms was quite stressful",NEGATIVE
"Perfectly clean, cousy, very friendly owners and staff. Far above 2 stars. The room was big enough, warm, well lighted, plenty of mirrors, comfortable beds. Verry happy with our stay.",POSITIVE
The stuff is so polite and nice people. The room is very good with big window and clean. Everything was nice!,POSITIVE
"It is 20 min (walking) far from the old town, but that's not a problem if you want to walk a bit more.",POSITIVE
There was a construction going on beside our room at 6am that woke us up very early then the smell of the paint reeked in the room. It was giving us headache. Complained to the front desk and all they said is that they are aware of the situation.,NEGATIVE
Very nice people....they gave us all the information required,POSITIVE

There are no comments available for this review,POSITIVE
Host was contactable and easy to chat to. Very accommodating.,POSITIVE
Apartment is a little small as only one bedroom. The three double beds are in the lounge which can be uncomfortable. It means packing away each day if you are wanting to sit and chill. If your out and about then it’s perfect.,POSITIVE
"Location was great. Fantastic breakfast in the wooden whisk.
Kevin was very accommodating. Very quick to reply.
Lovely city break.",POSITIVE

"Great location, the luas is right next to it so it’s very easy to get into the city. Room was clean and modern",POSITIVE

Location is closed to the city.  staff is kind.,POSITIVE

"Lovely size room and decor. Good location, very central and handy. Its good value for what you get.",POSITIVE
The light switch was not inside the door where you would expect so had to use my phone to find it beside the bed. The main light was gone in the bathroom only the over the mirror light was working. Rang reception they were to send up someone that never arrived.,NEGATIVE

The nicest thing was, as last time, they leave a little bag with a juice carton and granary biscuit outside your room door in the morning, bless them!",POSITIVE
"as they state on their website/booking website the place has a noisy night club in the basement so there is loud music on Friday night’s til 2am but I knew that from last time and they provide ear plugs should you wish to use them. I don’t mind that type of noise. Room could be warmer, it has two radiators but only one came on intermittently.",NEGATIVE
central and close to the luas line. made it easy to get over to o Connell street,POSITIVE
"location is great . luas stop right outside , nightclub down stairs staff were lovely",POSITIVE
if your not there to party then I would say the noise of the nightclub may be a bit much as we could here it on the second floor quite clearly … the bathroom light also was filled with water from the room above and hanging off the Ceiling which was quite dangerous to say the least,NEGATIVE

"I stayed at Acara House B&B with my girlfriend for 3 days. Great location (Drumcondra is very close to the city center) and various shops/supermarkets on this area. Mad props to Liz, one of the nicest hosts we’ve met in a while. She was lovely from the very beginning and gave us a warm welcome. Besides, she took the time to describe us every detail in order to make our stay way more enjoyable (and she did!).To sum up, this is a great place to stay if you want to keep yourself away (but not far away) from the city center.",POSITIVE

Fire alarm went off repeatedly between 1am and 2am each night, frightening both adults and children. Substance abuse people using building entrance. Apartment door bell not connected. Apartment floors filthy and dangerous in places. Short on crockery and cutlery. Very disappointed!",NEGATIVE
"Picked up keys from one location then got terrible directions to our hotel which took us an hour to find.cleaners were still in our room cleaning when we arrived. the hotel is in a very rough area of Dublin, we overlooked graffiti on shop roller doors and rough buildings. we would get charged if we used over our power allowance which we didn't know what it was !!!!. felt really unsafe in the neighborhood where hotel was located and we were two guys from south Auckland in NZ so nothing should of worried us but this place did.",NEGATIVE
"Prime location, supermarket downstairs",POSITIVE
"it was great value for money and well located
The property was very ideal for a group and spacious",POSITIVE
There was quite a lot of wear and tear around the apartment and we had to clean the bathrooms as they had strong smells in them,NEGATIVE
Turn d up to book in & property wasnâ€™t available. This ruined our trip to Dublin & left us walking the streets of Dublin until our flight the next day!,NEGATIVE
Really lovely staff all round. The location is excellent.,POSITIVE
very quiet but close to city centre,POSITIVE
Leaving!,NEGATIVE
Good location and value for the price you pay if you are the family or group of people 4-5. Communication with the host was very good.,POSITIVE
Some of the appliances and furniture are a bit worn out.,NEGATIVE
"The flat was very well equipped, clean and spacious in a convenient location.",POSITIVE
"As with everywhere in Dublin, its just so expensive! We were lucky to find this stay at a discounted rate but it was still £400 over the budget work had given for each of us.
But I don't think affordable accommodation exists in Dublin City Centre, so we were at least happy that the flat was nice.",NEGATIVE

breakfast fell short of everything else,NEGATIVE
"The location of this property is convenient and lots of things you would want are literally outside the door, including a Luis stop, SPAR, Marks & Sparks food, ATM, etc.    The apartment itself is pretty good.",POSITIVE
"The biggest challenge was the furniture.  Beds were great, but furniture in shared living area was not.  It has two couches.  Both are so low to the ground that it is hard to get off and onto them.  The first couch is literally broken and had a piece of 2x4 holding it up.  The second is newer and in better shape, but still extremely low to the ground.  The apartment was missing some basics that I would expect - parring knife, a functional bread knife (we had one but too dull to cut bread).  The frying pans were old teflon with lots of scratches.  I wouldn't and didn't use them.  Outside of not delivering key information until two days before arrival, our contact person was good, very nice and responsive to concerns we had about a breaker for the bathroom lights that was tripping on a regular basis.  However, there is only so far a good host can go when the furniture is uncomfortable.",NEGATIVE
Good location. The manage did his best to fix the kitchen tap that was broken.,POSITIVE
"The couch was broken and the bed in one room was uncomfortable, made a terrible noise when you sat on it and annoying when you were sleeping.",NEGATIVE

Nothing,NEGATIVE
Excellent location yet quiet at night. Fantastic staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Incredible value for the price.,POSITIVE
Lovely clean and comfortable room. Good heating so was nice and warm. The shower is lovely. The staff member carried my bags to my room and made conversation which was super nice.,POSITIVE
"Arrived early to drop off my bags and the place was completely locked up. I rang the number on the door sign that said ""ring this number if you want to drop off your bags early"" and it was invalid which was really annoying, and concerning that you can't even gain access to the hotel at all before 3pm.",NEGATIVE
There was only lukewarm water in the shower no matter what way we turned the dials,NEGATIVE
"the large room, high ceilings and big windows that opened.",POSITIVE
"coffee machine was great but was not monitored or refreshed. twice I asked for milk and had to ask to have the grinds removed- it’s a lovely touch, but only if it is usable.",NEGATIVE
"Booked a single room for a 2 night stay. It was clean and warm, bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was clean and modern, shower had hot water when needed",POSITIVE

room was clean and good location,POSITIVE
quite old fashioned and some of the reception staff weren’t very friendly,NEGATIVE
"Everything was alright, but flush in the toilet did not work",NEGATIVE
"I liked the easy check in, even before 14:00.The room was also very nice. Was what we expected.",POSITIVE
The windows could be improved. It felt like they were open when they weren't (sound),NEGATIVE
close to temple street hospital and also private parking.,POSITIVE
"great location, friendly and helpful staff",POSITIVE
"very very warm, window was open all night and fan was going all night. radiators weren’t even on.",NEGATIVE
"overall very nice place and enjoyable stay, the location is pretty good for walking to the O’Connell St area of theatres and shops etc, check in very nice and the room had everything you need! it’s a quiet area.",POSITIVE
"the room is quite small but then it’s a single room, bathroom good size. There could be a few more coat hangers in the room.",POSITIVE
The bed was very comfortable and the room was warm.,POSITIVE
"Very large room in a delightful grand old townhouse, with high ceilings and decorative furnishings. Deep carpet, comfortable beds, and excellent bathroom facilities. Tea and coffee provided with complimentary biscuits, and friendly staff. The whole family slept very well. Excellent location, about 20-30 minutes walk north of the Ha'penny Bridge and Temple Bar.",POSITIVE
"The lighting could have been better. There was a single bulb illuminating the centre of the room, and although there were bedside lamps, not all of them worked, and one of the plug sockets (admittedly out of site behind one of the beds) was broken and looked distinctly unsafe. Not everybody wants bright lights of course, but it's nice to have the option.Also, if your curtains are 10 or 12ft high it's quite a good idea to fit some sort of drawstring mechanism. I guess there's probably a knack to it, but this old man actually managed to wrench his shoulder trying to draw them.Also, there is a dining area downstairs, but it's tiny. We brought back a takeaway one night, and I felt like I was eating in a converted closet.Little niggles though, overall it was excellent.",NEGATIVE
Cleaness,POSITIVE
"radiator wouldn’t turn off - even with window open on our first night the room was roasting, plus traffic noise as a result meant that we had hardly any sleep. maintenance came and turned it off during our second day, but when back in the room it switched itself on again (without any interaction from us). maintenance came back to switch off again later that evening, and it stayed off for the rest of our stay. bulbs out on room too",NEGATIVE
"great personnel, very nice ppl and helpful",POSITIVE
"The Location is perfect to walk,well connected with the most interesting places to visit",POSITIVE

Was not mentioned that it was opposite the garden of  rememberance,NEGATIVE
"Amazing, would highly recommend! Perfect for our group of 6. The location was ideal for what we wanted…right in the middle of Temple Bar. It does get loud around this area but for a group of 24 year olds that’s exactly what we wanted so we wasn’t fussed at all. The apartment was extremely clean and had all furnishings needed. Thanks for our stay, we will be back for sure.",POSITIVE

Clean and modern facilities with lots of useful things like an iron and hair dryer, and even tea, coffee and milk on arrival!I booked several months ahead and had a few questions and clarifications I wanted from the host during this time. They are very quick to reply, helpful and professional.",POSITIVE
Not a problem for us but given central location may be noisier for people staying on sofa beds as fronts onto main bar street area. Picking up keys first at different location was a little more work but not hard to find or too far away.,POSITIVE
"Great location, really in the centre of Temple Bar.",POSITIVE
"No hot water, it tripped out day 1. It was repaired really quickly but ran out quickly. cold showers for three days.",NEGATIVE
"Fantastic, spacious apartment at the heart of Temple Bar. Walking distance to all the city centre attractions, and bus stops round the corner.",POSITIVE
"A bit noisy outside the living room, but that’s to be expected staying in such a busy area for bars and restaurants. Noise at night from people coming in and out the building was irritating. Wi-Fi signal needs boosting as it was unreliable did didn’t cover the whole apartment.",NEGATIVE

"The staff were amazing, wonderful welcome upon late checkin, room was small but warm, clean and comfortable, at breakfast (really good) the next morning the staff were making a real effort and I witnessed many moments of kindness by the staff which is so refreshing to see.

Location was excellent. It is very close to all the temple bar activity but on a quite block where you can sleep. It is 1/2 block to the river and about 5 blocks to Temple bar main area. The apt was very clean and functional. Overall excellent. I would stay there again.,POSITIVE

Wonderful location. Very nice host.,POSITIVE
A little a bit more cleaning would be great.,NEGATIVE
The location was excellent and the accomodation was comfortable.,POSITIVE
"Firstly, there was a problem with the communication on arrival. We were told that we would be met at the appartment on arrival. I therefore sent messages to the number given to me by email about our time of arrival but received no reply and had to phone the host after our arrival to find out how to access a key.
Secondly, we were unable to access a wifi connection and a message to our host requesting help was met with no response. There appeared to be an issue with the modem’s security which needs to be addressed.",NEGATIVE

The bathroom was a bit dated and needs some TLC,NEGATIVE

"The kitchen area looked really good at first but attention to detail was lacking somewhat. Half empty bottle of water in fridge. Very limited tea/ coffee for a stay that was a few days. Cutlery was not cleaned fully and there were still bits of someones food on them, especially the forks. There were fake tan stains all over the bathroom door also. The pillows were super uncomfortable to be honest. We did ask for extra in advance so we could hopefully switch them round to suit but they never gave us any.",NEGATIVE
I loved the shower,POSITIVE
Having a broom in the room.,POSITIVE
"Fantastic property, perfect location for anyone going to a concert in the 3arena. Luas right outside the door too. Great facilities in the building too!",POSITIVE
"Needed the same card that was used for the booking but it was paid by the company I work for so I didn’t have it with me. When I was booking, there was nothing to say that I wouldn’t be charged in full at the time of booking and that it wouldn’t be charged until I checked in. I then needed to use a personal card despite having my work card details just not the physical card. Quite annoying to stay our trip.",NEGATIVE

"Brilliant hotel, next door to 3 arena, and right beside a train stop.",POSITIVE

"Location is brilliant,  staff were very helpful, overall very good value for money.",POSITIVE
"Staff was super friendly and kind (all the different people we met in the reception during our stay). The location is very nice because the hotel is located to an independent neighborhood but it is also close to the main city center (""The Temple Bar"" it's about 25 minutes on foot). Bus stops are exactly in front of the hotel while you can find supermarkets and restaurants everywhere around the hotel!",POSITIVE
The only thing I can think is that some nights I could use a different (harder) pillow. Besides that everything else was super nice and comfortable!,POSITIVE
good value stay near to some good facilities,POSITIVE

"The check-in process is terrible. The office where you pick up your keys is more than a 20 minute walk from the apartment itself. This is not made clear and may require two taxis, one to the office and a second one to the apartment. Inside the apartment some of the cabinet faces were delaminated.

"Price I paid through Booking.com - €465 for 5 nights could be slightly more moderate.
Breakfast was filling yet could incorporate greater variety, e.g. soy/almond milk, marmite.
Availing a microwave oven and refrigerator was convenient, however can improve by not having to go outside and around the corner from the main entrance.",NEGATIVE

Perfect for tourists (like me). I just stayed one night, so it was good.",POSITIVE

"Great location, very close to many attractions/food/transportation, hostel can organize many different activities for you. Not much variety for breakfast, but I also can't complain since breakfast was included in the price and I didn't have to pay extra.",POSITIVE
It was difficult to find my room and then find the exit as this hostel appears to be two buildings connected via different hallways.,NEGATIVE

Clean and modern facilities with lots of useful things like an iron and hair dryer, and even tea, coffee and milk on arrival!I booked several months ahead and had a few questions and clarifications I wanted from the host during this time. They are very quick to reply, helpful and professional.",POSITIVE
Not a problem for us but given central location may be noisier for people staying on sofa beds as fronts onto main bar street area. Picking up keys first at different location was a little more work but not hard to find or too far away.,POSITIVE

Little noisy on some nights and the seagulls will drive you mad every morning they wake you up,POSITIVE

Location was excellent. It is very close to all the temple bar activity but on a quite block where you can sleep. It is 1/2 block to the river and about 5 blocks to Temple bar main area. The apt was very clean and functional. Overall excellent. I would stay there again.,POSITIVE

A little a bit more cleaning would be great.,NEGATIVE
The location was excellent and the accomodation was comfortable.,POSITIVE
"Firstly, there was a problem with the communication on arrival. We were told that we would be met at the appartment on arrival. I therefore sent messages to the number given to me by email about our time of arrival but received no reply and had to phone the host after our arrival to find out how to access a key.
Secondly, we were unable to access a wifi connection and a message to our host requesting help was met with no response. There appeared to be an issue with the modem’s security which needs to be addressed.",NEGATIVE
"It was a good location, close to the city center, shops and restaurants. The apartment was fairly sized with enough sleeping spaces for everyone in my party",POSITIVE
The bathroom was a bit dated and needs some TLC,NEGATIVE
"The doors to the rooms slam shut, I assume because they are fire doors but there could maybe be some sort of absorption pad added to frames to minimise this effect. It was quite disruptive and I imagine if you had a restless child, it wouldn't help your situation!",NEGATIVE
"Great location for Temple Bar area, very accommodating!",POSITIVE
"There was no breakfast included. The apartment was pretty roomy and relatively quiet. Easy to get to. The manager is a little slow to answer emails and texts, but easy to reach by phone.",POSITIVE

"The kitchen area looked really good at first but attention to detail was lacking somewhat. Half empty bottle of water in fridge. Very limited tea/ coffee for a stay that was a few days. Cutlery was not cleaned fully and there were still bits of someones food on them, especially the forks. There were fake tan stains all over the bathroom door also. The pillows were super uncomfortable to be honest. We did ask for extra in advance so we could hopefully switch them round to suit but they never gave us any.",NEGATIVE
I loved the shower,POSITIVE
Having a broom in the room.,POSITIVE
"Fantastic property, perfect location for anyone going to a concert in the 3arena. Luas right outside the door too. Great facilities in the building too!",POSITIVE
"Needed the same card that was used for the booking but it was paid by the company I work for so I didn’t have it with me. When I was booking, there was nothing to say that I wouldn’t be charged in full at the time of booking and that it wouldn’t be charged until I checked in. I then needed to use a personal card despite having my work card details just not the physical card. Quite annoying to stay our trip.",NEGATIVE
Great value for money.  Very convenient when going to the 3 Arena.,POSITIVE
"Brilliant hotel, next door to 3 arena, and right beside a train stop.",POSITIVE
"The location is great, at the front of the building is a bus station and a tram. There are also shops and restaurants itd. It is 25 min walking to the centre. Apartments have all that you could possible need for a short or a long stay. In is quiet.",POSITIVE
You could hear all the voices from other apartments - loudly and clearly.,NEGATIVE

"Location is brilliant,  staff were very helpful, overall very good value for money.",POSITIVE
"Staff was super friendly and kind (all the different people we met in the reception during our stay). The location is very nice because the hotel is located to an independent neighborhood but it is also close to the main city center (""The Temple Bar"" it's about 25 minutes on foot). Bus stops are exactly in front of the hotel while you can find supermarkets and restaurants everywhere around the hotel!",POSITIVE
The only thing I can think is that some nights I could use a different (harder) pillow. Besides that everything else was super nice and comfortable!,POSITIVE
good value stay near to some good facilities,POSITIVE
our room was a bit cold and there really are no thrills to a Travellodge,NEGATIVE
"The bathrooms needs updating, get rid of the showers over the bath",NEGATIVE

"Great location, lovely spacious luxurious room. It can be a bit noisy but to me that’s all part of staying in the middle of temple bar and just adds to the atmosphere.",POSITIVE
Having to check in at a specific time is a bit restricting but after that minor inconvenience it was just a lovely stay in a lovely room,POSITIVE
"Will furnished, secure, and quiet",POSITIVE

"Very well located in Temple Bar, but so well insulated you couldn’t hear the noise.",POSITIVE
The room was lovely and big. Very quiet since the location is central Temple Bar. The staff were lovely and eager to help us in anyway possible.,POSITIVE
"A small issue of the bathroom door didn't close fully, left a gap around which didn't give the privacy you would like when using a bathroom. The shower kept going from cold to hot in waves also. I think this is due to the low pressure.",NEGATIVE

Perfect for tourists (like me). I just stayed one night, so it was good.",POSITIVE
Everything was fine!,POSITIVE
"Great location, very close to many attractions/food/transportation, hostel can organize many different activities for you. Not much variety for breakfast, but I also can't complain since breakfast was included in the price and I didn't have to pay extra.",POSITIVE

"little cold 
10am checkout is very early",NEGATIVE
"Paid for outside space which wasn't provided. Check in was ok, however, preparation was poor as no towels. Facilities had to searched for and some were found in a cupboard stating it was the property of the owner. Cleanliness was average at best and there was no hot water throughout our stay. a â‚¬400 security deposit was taken which when you sum up the state of the place and the lack of facilities, seems very excessive.",NEGATIVE

It was the first time of my family in Ireland and they absolutely loved the apartment.
I would recommend it to any big group or family.",POSITIVE

"could be cleaner … also there was a little swarm of 4-5 flies constantly hovering under the main light in my room, I managed to catch one of them (weirdly) but it was unpleasant having flies in the room in the first place and flying around you! They ought to put a fly trap in the room or something.",NEGATIVE
"It was the worst ever communication with a do called customer service. They have no reception and therefore they send you nothing really helpful you tube videos of how to put the key out of the lockbox then walking to the apartment. No address where to find the belfaSt bike station!!! Even after several calls they only told us to watch the video. First the video didn’t show you where the lockbox is, Second we couldn’t watch it without WiFi!!! 
After a kind of treasure hunt was the lockbox empty, ten minutes before official check in and they told us we would be able to check in from two o clock!
Before heading with your car to the parking place, you have to enter the apartment to got the white card for parking garage entry! 
Headed to the flat, Meeting the cleaner at three, have to wait until she finished until twenty past three, we couldn’t find the parking card. Customer service we called, waiter for a call back to us. Leave the car at the park and display and second night in a parking garage.
The customer service never come back to us. 
Unbelievable! Should recommend everyone to have a look around for another place to stay.",NEGATIVE

"The room itself was nice, the personnel was extremely helpful to all our needs. The location is great. Dublin itself was wonderful. And it was at the very least affordable, because everything else in Dublin was so f- expensive. The city itself is cheap, but the housing - good God.",POSITIVE
"It was COLD. And not only the room, everything in Ireland was so cold - the restaurants, the bars, the shops, everything. And I am not usually a 30-degrees-only person. The room itself was poorly isolated and the radiators made very little difference. The personnel however helped out with a heater!",NEGATIVE

Nothing! :),NEGATIVE
Perfect location & handy grocery store nearby,POSITIVE
"Hotel decor, comfortable bed, nice bathroom. Very clean throughout.",POSITIVE
"All good, except the kitchen door to balcony was difficult to open & shut so we left it alone which didn’t bother us.",NEGATIVE
"I had booked airport pickup, & the driver picked up the keys for me, so we went straight to the apartment instead of stopping by the office for check-in.",NEGATIVE
Very minor…One of the beds could have been better (cleaned).,NEGATIVE

"Good space 
Comfy beds
Staff at pick up office very good and accommodating",POSITIVE
"Location a bit far out of town for us. 
Floor was not clean. Needed a good wash rather than a hoover.
No instructions left for equipment.
Was left a note to say someine had been in the appartment on our first day to fix something. We had not been made aware at check-in that someone would be going in. Wasn't happy that someone had let themselves in without our knowledge",NEGATIVE
Very clean & comfortable. Good location,POSITIVE

The room was very neat and big enough,POSITIVE
Location was fantastic and car rental right opposite was a bonus. Apartment was well equipped.,POSITIVE
"Not dislikes but shower only goes to lukewarm and then cold so extremely quick showers had.
TV was all in Spanish which we finally managed to change but everytime we turned the TV on we had to reset everything again and no channel's other than Netflix. If you haven't got an account then forget it.",NEGATIVE

When you let water out of kitchen sink it came up in shower tray

"Perfect location, equidistant between Croke Park and Temple Bar, right off O'Connell Street. Super easy to get keys, and host in great communication throughout to let us know when it was OK to check in, and what to do on check out. Bed very comfortable, and bedroom a good size. Sofa also comfy, and kitchen well appointed for the size of the flat. Good wifi that allowed us to stream a Netflix show in the evening (using our own Amazon stick which we had brought with us). Nice bathroom, with decent pressure in the shower.",POSITIVE
The water system can be a bit noisy - best not flush the toilet at night (although the noise doesn't last long). The flat is far nicer than the communal stairway may indicate.,NEGATIVE
Room clean. Food good.,POSITIVE
It was close to the city centre and around a 15 minute walk to the Croke park stadium where we were going to a concert.,POSITIVE
It was on the 3rd floor so quite a lot of stairs and no lift.,NEGATIVE
A good location quite close to the central parts of Dublin. Bus to the ferryport passes the property. Good wifi. The apartment was quite spacious and was secure.,POSITIVE
"Complete lack of any instructions for using equipment such as the cooker, TV, shower. Collection of keys was a problem as the code was sent after I had started to make the journey to Dublin and I could not access the email sent to me. Details about the property state that upper floors are accessible only by stairs - it was not clear that the flat was on the third floor and necessitated climbing six flights of stairs.",NEGATIVE
The location is great to visit dublin. The rooms were pleasant and made up to feel good and safe.There was free coffee which was very much appreciated by us.,POSITIVE
it was rather hard for us to find the correct house and furthermore to get the keys.The house number is doubled in the address: 24 24 Gresham House is given - but it's 24 Gresham House.That confused us a bit as we searched for 2424 at first - we are not the brightest obviously.The keys can be picked up at a different location - a sports bar. We did not know that and it was not shown in the booking App. However we managed to contact the host via Phone and WhatsApp and we finally got the information how to pick up the keys... pheeew... The free coffee in the apparment helped us to stop the headache that was coming on.,NEGATIVE
"very nice location, comfortable with a good wifi and well decorated.
well located within a walking distance to the main attractions.
supermarket around the corner was convenient for breakfast.
Sixt rental car is just nearby which is also convenient.",POSITIVE

Very delicious breakfast, clean room and cozy atmosphere! We will definitely come back!",POSITIVE
Car park tight spaces but got one so happy with that.,POSITIVE
"Michael and Mike are very kind and super hosts, they are very welcoming and happy to help. We had a great stay with Michael and Mike. The house is in a very quiet neighborhood but the center of Dublin is not far away. There are bus stops close to the house.  The breakfast is very good and in your room you have water, lemonade, tea, coffee , biscuits available.The rooms are charming and beautifully decorated and very clean.We know where to stay when going to Dublin!",POSITIVE
"All was perfect, nothing to mention here.",POSITIVE
"Mike & Michaelâ€™s home was the best place to stay to explore Dublin. The room was perfect- it had everything we needed and more including a snack selection and a complimentary bottle of fizz for new years, which was a lovely touch. 
The Homestay is very well connected to the city centre and the airport via public transport and we were given very helpful instructions from the airport. 
Throughout our stay, Mike & Michael were generous with their time and recommendations of pubs, restaurants & Dublin attractions. We also loved meeting Buttons & Twix! 
Thank you again for everything - our experience at your Homestay was a big part of why we had such a great time in Dublin!",POSITIVE
Price for the room was respectable for the location. Friendly staff and a quick check in.,POSITIVE
Check out is a bit early at 10.30am and checking in isn't possible before,NEGATIVE
The location is amazing. The staff is also nice.,POSITIVE
Itâ€™s very old and needs a renovation. The bathroom was moldy. If you need something cheap in the city center this works,NEGATIVE
First experience in a hostel. excelente private bathroom and location if you are interested in the Temple Bar area. 6.5/10 for confort and the fact that you need to place ur own bed lining. But the duvet was warm and room was always at the perfect temperature for a freezing weather outside. Summarizingâ€¦ itâ€™s not a hotel but worth what u pay for.,POSITIVE
Maybe the cleannessâ€¦ not bad cause the sheets were smelling nice but there were hairs around the sheets or floors. Also keep in mind itâ€™s next to a club so donâ€™t forget earplugs for a better sleep.,NEGATIVE
"Location, hospitality and friendliness at the reception, ready to help, nice kitchen, clean and cosy rooms, heating, the luggage room",POSITIVE
The rooms are really clean and the facilities are excellent.,POSITIVE

"There was no staff onsite so although they offered the facility to store luggage when we arrived, we couldn't because there was nobody to pay.",NEGATIVE
It was not very clean and during the night a green light so it was difficult to sleep with the light.,NEGATIVE
"We liked the location, the noise does not disturb you from the outside.",POSITIVE
The bathroom was not as clean as it could be. Be careful when leaving your food in common fridges. It can be stolen.,NEGATIVE
"Small, pretty basic room with no TV but was 
clean & comfortable!",POSITIVE
check in was very smooth. friendly lounge. excellent facilities. 10/10,POSITIVE
"Location. Very tense. Enormously under the spell of...? 
Hostel cleaners. rude. no manners. arrogant. boorish. very inexperienced. reluctant to be decent.  A lot of dirty looks. staring. abilty to be very very hostile. totally unwelcoming. arrogant. imperious. bad attitude. negative. judgemental.",NEGATIVE
"Location was really good, closeby to public transport and the mail streets. Room was nice and clean, nice little own bathroom with okay shower.",POSITIVE
There was a lot of noise and smells and warmth coming from the restaurant below us right in our room untill 3 at night. The entire room smelled like fastfood and was either really warm with the windows closed or really loud noises from the air ventilation from the restaurant with the windows open (also when closed it was loud),NEGATIVE
Mattresses need to be changed,NEGATIVE
Decent value for 4 lads travelling to Dublin for one night.,POSITIVE
"Lock box access was open to abuse as people seemed to be milling around the property. Rooms were okay, but the shower didn't have any hot water",NEGATIVE
"Had lockers and privacy curtains which were very much appreciated, excellent value for money.",POSITIVE
"Bathrooms were great, apart from a pretty poor shower but it's useable and is a minor point",POSITIVE

"Had a lovely weekend away with my sister and Mother visiting from France. The location was perfect to visit Dublin, plenty to do close by and most pubs//restaurants nearby. Safe location.The apartment was cosy, clean and comfortable. Even the sofa bed was good quality.",POSITIVE
"comfortable room with excellent layout, including a full kitchen with oven, cookware, fridge and Nespresso machine.  Bed was acceptable as was the bathroom.",POSITIVE
"After 5 attempts to get the TV internet services active so I could stream Netflix, I gave up.  No one bothered to come to the room to resolve the issue.  Also, there's no phone to reception...so every incident requires a trip downstairs.  And don't expect a full balcony...basically doors to open for fresh air...not a big deal, but some truth in advertising would go a long way.  Lastly, there's no daily housekeeping.  I get that it's a self-contained unit.  However, when I'm paying the same daily rate for 7-nights, as someone that's just staying one night, and the housekeepers clean daily stays, it seems rather cheap.",NEGATIVE
"Great location, 4 min walk to Vicar St. Pub next door and close to city centre",POSITIVE
"Balcony was small, otherwise place was perfect.",POSITIVE
Shower ran out of hot water also insufficient hot water to shaveAs an improvement it would be helpful to add hooks or a hanging rail inside the cupboard in the hall. that way wet coats could be hung up,NEGATIVE
Bus station to the city centre was just outisde the accommodation. A little too far to walk on foot but the public transport is excellent and on point. Room was clean and also the kitchen for breakfast. Highly recommended for a good budget.,POSITIVE

"it was noisy, since my room faced the street",NEGATIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
"The bus stops right outside going to towards city centre and the other way to the airport was ideal, which were only €5.20 for 2 people compared to the taxis which were overly expensive. Although 2 miles from city centre it is ideal as it has pubs and restaurants as well as Lidl and Tesco on the doorstep. Great location",POSITIVE
"Nothing really, it doesn't serve a hot breakfast, but we knew that prior to booking so not a problem.",POSITIVE
"clean room , central location",POSITIVE
on a busy street,POSITIVE

"Outside noises were loud, people yelling and singing all throughout the night. the widows are just too thin to insulate noise and weather. also the door slamming downstairs was so loud to us as well (1st floor). maybe there can be something done to insulate the windows and to slow does the front door from slamming.",NEGATIVE
Beds were comfortable. Clean. Very warm. Relatively quiet. Excellent location.,POSITIVE
Shower was a bit unpredictable. Had to learn about Irish immersion water heaters. An interesting concept. Bit confusing as to entering   apartment.,NEGATIVE
"amazing location, very spacious and modern",POSITIVE
there was a building site that started early in the morning so a tad noisy.,NEGATIVE

Couldnt fault anything.,POSITIVE
"Good location, short walk to most places, spacious, clean.",POSITIVE
"bed wasn’t the best, can be rather noisy on the side street with late passer-by’s.",NEGATIVE
location was great!,POSITIVE
WiFi instructions in binder were wrong; had to figure out how to connect by looking at the router.,NEGATIVE
"I liked that the location was very close to the center of the city and a short walk many tourist attractions and bars/restaurants. Our host was also very responsive and accommodating, especially with allowing us to drop our luggage off early before check-in. The apartment was very clean and quite comfortable, and had everything we needed.",POSITIVE
"The ""look"" of the apartment was not the most stylish, and a couple small things (including the lock on the bathroom door) were broken. The street the apartment also seemed to be the go-to destination for drunk tourists/locals to urinate on the walls, so the smell going in and out the front door wasn't great. The price was a bit more expensive than I think it ought to be, but then again, I booked late so can't complain too much about the places that were still available. The apartment served the purposes of me and my group and we still felt safe and comfortable in the space.",NEGATIVE
The apartment is inside the city center! The total room was OK and generally we had no problems during our accommodation.  Finally UT is very well equipped.,POSITIVE
"Very spacious, comfortable beds, extremely clean.",POSITIVE
Occasionally smelled cigarette smoke from another unit that is occupied by full time tenants.,NEGATIVE
"lovely decor and was nice and warm. The bar staff were really friendly, the restaurant served great food and the hotel was in a decent location.",POSITIVE
confusion around how we got into property and how we locked up after,NEGATIVE
"Great location, absolutely spotless and very modern. Everything you need in the apartment, very close to shops and pubs.",POSITIVE
"They donâ€™t have a life so you have to walk up a few flights of stairs with cases & bags etc but donâ€™t let it put you off, itâ€™s well worth it!",POSITIVE
"Clean linen and spare blankets , pillows and duvet if needed . Amazing location .central to everything abs our host gave tourist recommendations which we took up and thoroughly enjoyed . Check out was easy and great communication with host during our stay . Excellent would recommend Celtic nights abs the vintage tea on the bus - marvelous",POSITIVE
We could not access live tv but that could have been our inability to work the controls . We could not find a plug so washed our dishes in the large saucepan . We could have contacted host about these issues but for us they did not really impair the quality of our stay . We just made do with a smile ðŸ˜ƒ,NEGATIVE
"Very nice, clean and aromatic apartment in a good location.
The windows are beautiful and big sash windows",POSITIVE
"As this is a multiple apartment block. Some people keep leaving the front door unlocked which is a bit of a concern when you are not in the apartment.
The local area is a little run down.
The sash window in the bedroom is single glazed and let's a lot of noise in which is disruptive to sleep. Probably would make the apartment very cold in the winter as the windows in the living room are also single glazed.",NEGATIVE
Great central location just off Oâ€™Connell street with the airport bus stop just over the road. Friendly staff with good facilities.,POSITIVE
Bedrooms could have been cleaner as dust on sides and floors.,NEGATIVE
"The location was fantastic, perfect for us to get to the arena and to temple bar. Easy access to shops to pick up breakfast and essentials for our trip. It was also really quiet as well which helped for a good night's sleep after an evening singing our hearts out in several lovely pubs.",POSITIVE
the beds were too firm and the shower wasn’t very powerful,NEGATIVE
"The TV didn't have live channels but it didn't matter because that just meant we had to go watch the rugby in a pub with a Guinness, what a shame! The shower was also a bit odd and the water came out in bursts rather than a steady flow but it was nothing unmanageable.",NEGATIVE
"great position, close to the city centre
lots of room",POSITIVE
not so clean,NEGATIVE
Spacious accommodation,POSITIVE
Not the nicest part of town,NEGATIVE
staff made the experience wonderful! excellent stay!,POSITIVE
The location was perfect. Only 10 minutes walk to the centre. The staff was lovely and the gave us the room before the check in which we really appreciated because we had chance to leave our things in the room. The room was quiet and any noise at night. The kitchen has everything you need to cook and honestly the place is worthy 100%.,POSITIVE
The only can say was about the size of the bed but we sleep very good anyway.,POSITIVE
close to tram and city,POSITIVE
parking is tough,NEGATIVE
"The location is fine, beds are correct for a few nights.",POSITIVE
"The staff wasn't polite, didn't even say hello. They don't care about you basically. Plus the doors are noisy, the walls not soundproofing, bathroom not cleverly designed. It's not welcoming as you can imagine.",NEGATIVE
"Value for money. En suite room with plenty of sockets. One towel provided per person. Kitchen equipped with utensils and basic appliances (fridge, microwave, kettle). Only one chair inside the room. Very close to tram station and bus stop.",POSITIVE
"Hairdryer only available on request and we can only have it for when we are using it (borrow it from reception and return immediately after, which is a little inconvenient). Toilet and bathroom is combined, so like other reviewers said they do get wet, I agree that they should at least provide a floor mat for when we step out of the bathroom. Bed is definitely smaller than a double, so be prepared for a squeeze if you're average sized.",NEGATIVE
The location was good due to the Luas being very close. Friendliness of staff,POSITIVE
"The accommodation was very tired and needed attention. Artistic license had been used for the marketing photos, it was a room with bare walls, a bed and wardrobe with no coat hangers. The common area of lounge and kitchen, although surface clean was looking very secondhand. The sofas were worn and missing the vinyl  covering making their cleanliness questionable, very reluctant to use them.  When opening the oven door the glass was detached, so unable to use the oven.  No means of washing up, ie liquid or tea towel, if spending a few days in Dublin you don’t expect to have to take this with you.  The smoke detector was constantly bleeping even though this was reported to housekeeping/reception no action was taken.",NEGATIVE
"Decent location, simple check in, comfortable bed, access to kitchen.",POSITIVE
"Only one roll of toilet paper, no shampoo or soap. No bathroom floor rug, so water got everywhere.",NEGATIVE

"Very nice Building, comfortable rooms",POSITIVE
room staff location,POSITIVE
Having a kitchen and lounge,POSITIVE
"With the necessary window open, very noisy",NEGATIVE
"No breakfast, the room was clearly unclean, with only a bedding change in site. It had multiple different hair types, clearly visible on entrance to Bathroom/Room/Bed/Kitchen/Lounge.Our room after spending all day out of it, we came to find, didn’t lock! Somebody came tightened a screw, it locked but within our next 2 hours it was broken again! My girlfriend of 2 years, (our anniversary trip) felt uneasy to sleep in an unlocked room, even with myself on the door side and having wedged, under the door gap with my own clothes, for her to be able to rest on our last night! We feel a response and a refund is valid.",NEGATIVE
"Cleanliness, Security, Info,",POSITIVE
The lifts worked well.,POSITIVE
The room was stiflingly hot. There was no soap in the bathroom and it was impossible to have a decent shower without the toilet getting soaked as the screen was inadequate.,NEGATIVE
every apartment is super comfortable the bed is wonderful!  perfect location!  the building condo very clean and beautiful!  great area!  The employee who comes to deliver the key super helpful and very polite!  I will come back more often in this wonderful apartment in a great area in Dublin,POSITIVE
Location perfect,POSITIVE
"Terrible bed, bedding and pillows. Couldn’t sleep properly",NEGATIVE
"Location is great, the guy who did the check in was nice.",POSITIVE
"Members of the staff have been exceptionally friendly and easy-going. Even though hotel is in front of a train station - we did not hear a bit of the noise, great sound isolation.",POSITIVE
"The photos did not match the standard of accommodation. The ceilings are dirty, cracks in the walls, well worn bed sheets, a shower that could only be turned on by turning on the sink. The TV set up.is also precarious to say the least. The place is not to an acceptable standard for the associated price",NEGATIVE
"nice room, bathroom and location.",POSITIVE

"A very lovely welcoming couple who run the B&B, welcomed any questions about the area or the stay accommodations we needed, and was extremely clean and walking distance from Dublin.",POSITIVE
The shower was freezing the next morning. Could not be used at all. Luckily we were only in Dublin for shopping and not an event - that would have been a disaster. I didn't mention it to the reception staff as our stay was short and we didn't want to be moved room or someone come in to fix it,NEGATIVE
No complaints at all.,POSITIVE
we loved the breakfast variety and flexibility,POSITIVE
maybe the roof window could be a bit more “closed” with a second protection for windy nights (otherwise everything was absolutely perfect !),NEGATIVE
"- very confortable bedroom
- friendly owner
- really like the first floor of house
- nice and confortable bed
- the price is totally acceptable",POSITIVE
- the location is a little far away (30 mins to the city center). It is not a big problem.,POSITIVE
"Absolutely pleasant atmosphere at home, good communication with the owners.  It's like being at home with family.  Cozy Christmas atmosphere.  Very quiet and comfortable area.  Easy and quick access to the city center and the airport.  Nearby is the botanical garden, which is interesting to visit even in winter.  The room and facilities were very comfortable and clean.  Good breakfast for self-service, tea, coffee.  Everything is perfect in this place.I will gladly stay here next time.",POSITIVE

"The apartment is ideally located in Dublin. In 15 minutes you can visit most part of museum, churchs, parks, access to Temple bar sector with wonderful atmosphere in Irish Pub and singers, very complete meals in restaurants.",POSITIVE
"Nb of chairs was not enough regarding to nb of people but we found solution in the living room with sofa. So that's ok.By the way, we were in Dublin for New Year period and the main things happens in Irish Pubs, not in the apartment ;-)Thanks to the owner who answered all our questions before our arrival. That was a great moment.",POSITIVE
"Excellent location, very quiet and central. Secure car parking was great. Apartment was very well equipped. Beds comfortable.",POSITIVE

"No heating in living area, economy 7 heating didn't work at all amd the tiny radiator that was provided did not heat up past luke warm.  Freezing g in Dublin I  January.  This is not adequate at all and quote unacceptable.",NEGATIVE
No corkscrew!  And no instructions at all for the property so had to call the host for a guide to the very complicated TV setup.,NEGATIVE
Location was in a rough part of Dublin. Felt uncomfortable walking home. Beds were small I'm 6ft2. No water in room.,NEGATIVE

Going to the pub to check in,POSITIVE
"Great location for shops, Bar/restaurants, live music and sightseeing",POSITIVE
"Trouble getting into the main key coded front door when first got there as did another younger couple, bar staff very helpful when eventually found as the door was jammed. Didn’t like the fact people having access from restaurants below when going to the ladies toilet could go up the stairs to all the appointments, one night when we where in our apartment someone came all the way up to our top floor apartment and tried the door then tried all the doors going back down. Needs a key coded door between stairs to the apartments and ladies toilet landing.  Thermostat didn’t work so no hot radiator / towel rail to dry towels. Luckily got heat fro aircon in main bedroom.",NEGATIVE
Room was clean and tidy and a very comfy bed!,POSITIVE
The sheets on one side of the bed were stained,NEGATIVE
"stylish, comfortable and clean",POSITIVE
"no information on wifi (I think there was supposed to be a booklet of info sheet, but we couldn’t find one)",NEGATIVE
"I was a bit surprised as this is more of an Airbnb than a hotel. No front desk, elevator or room key. We had to ask the staff at the neighboring restaurant for information on how to access the room. Once we were in the room it was fine. I will say that I would stay here again knowing what I know.",NEGATIVE
"The main door to the building was heavy and didn’t lock, even though there was a key pad.",NEGATIVE
"great location, right in the heart of Dublin.",POSITIVE
"rooms are apartment style with no lobby or staff onsite. 
very loud. you can hear every door open/close in 
the hallway as well as people speaking. there is a 
bar directly downstairs which tends to be noisy late.",NEGATIVE
Location and very smart,POSITIVE
"Needs a chair in the room to call it a suite
The electronic lock expecially the front door needs to be improved. Staff extremely helpful but saying a lot of people have trouble with the front door means you are not listening to your customers",NEGATIVE
"The location was conveniently, the room was very clean and had everything we needed",POSITIVE
The tiling in the bathroom was a little tired in places and the towel rail was in a silly place and hurt my head but otherwise really happy!,NEGATIVE
"I did not receive the email with details of how to get into the property, which was self check in. I then had a lot of difficulties contacting someone to sort this, I sent several emails to the Clarendon Suites and Booking.com with no response. The phone number I was given wasn’t answered and there was no facility to leave a message. I finally got an answer on the phone just before I travelled.  . I found all this stressful and very unsatisfactory",NEGATIVE
"Perfect location close to Grafton street. Modern, clean room and lovely bathroom. Loved the self check in.",POSITIVE
"The location of the property was perfect, just 10mins the walk to Blanchardstown Shopping Centre and quick bus ride into Dublin City centre!

Nothing everything ist Perfect!,POSITIVE
"Fiona and Liam were very accommodating and approachable. The building is a really lovely victorian renovated home, the area is near Stoneybatter and Phibsboro which have a ton of restaurants and pubs. The area was central, we walked to Smithfield in 15 min, or took the Luas to where we needed to go, which was an 8 min walk down the road. The apartment had everything we needed and we made it our place, it was very comfortable and well worth the price!",POSITIVE
"Not much we didn't like but some amenities in the room were outdated and needed an upgrade/better clean (oven), but they worked fine!
Needed more spare towels/bed sheets
The bathroom could use a fan in the studio apartment we stayed in",POSITIVE
Location and cleanliness,POSITIVE
"We weren't given any info upon checking in about what time or where breakfast was, about the other bars or restaurant opening times within the hotel. We weren't advised that the gym was closed and there were no bath robes in the room. I also ordered strawberries dipped in chocolates which never arrived either.",NEGATIVE
"Everything as it should be. Ease key collection, cozy and warm place. We did not find bed sheets for the sofas, they are inside of one of them, don't worry :) Absolutely superb price/(quality+location) ratio, thank you and thank you for the baby cradle!",POSITIVE
"On the outskirts of Dublin, about 40 minutes walk into the centre but public transport options probably available. Roadside parking outside the property. Pubs/restaurants/shops reasonably close.",POSITIVE
TV basic (not smart). A bit cramped for 4 people.,NEGATIVE
"Easy reach of Dublin by bus, only 10mins. Walked to Croke Park for concert. Bed was comfortable. Good powerful shower. Quick response from hosts with query on TV. Easy access to the apartment. Clean. Taxi to airport was only €30 and booked using Free Now app so no need to get bus to City then out to the apt.",POSITIVE
"Very small shower cubicle, no decent glasses for us to have some wine in the room but made use of the cups so no big deal.",NEGATIVE
"Location was really good and near to local bus routes. The studio was small but perfectly formed.
The bathroom was a good size and clean.
Best for us is that we had a quiet stay and slept amazing!

convenient location for centre of Dublin amenities all good,POSITIVE
Location was good as it was central and just 22mins from the airport. Rooms are spacious.,POSITIVE
"The property needs a deep clean. There were cobwebs all over, garden needs maintaining and bins outside were overflowing and smelly. It was obvious that the property wasn't cleaned for our our arrival.We spent the first two nights without heating as the radiators wouldn't work. Called the agents and they said someone would come by to fix it. No one did. I sent several messages, on day 2, including pictures requested by the agent, and all we were told was that it had been passed on to a manager and awaiting his response. No one called back or came round.",NEGATIVE
location space and privacy,POSITIVE
nothing,NEGATIVE
Covid restrictions were easied except for masks but was told there was no residents bar and could not get a drink past 1230. Very disappointing seen as we were looking forward to this as we wouldn't be comfortable in a late bar or nightclub with  covid. Breakfast to the room wasn't what we ordered.,NEGATIVE

Temple Bar was just around the corner, walking distance to a lot of attractions. Short walk to pick up point for a lot of tours.Definitely book again when I bring my husband to Dublin ...",POSITIVE

The shower was good and the bed was comfortable.,POSITIVE
"The other residents in the property, I was confronted by one resident questioning my booking and later in the evening, an Gardai attended the property to deal with a disturbance. I had certain expectations given the location of the property but this was a terrible experience and I did not feel at ease given the other tenants in the property. €100 per night is not justified for this room.",NEGATIVE
The space was very clean.,POSITIVE
It is just not worth the price at all.,NEGATIVE
The Front door could be open to the left hand side and we had a wrong Instruction for front door,NEGATIVE

"The hotel is right in the city centre, so the location is second to none. Staff are cheery and eager to help.",POSITIVE
"This place is in desperate need of some TLC. Our room (307) was on the top floor, the stairs are incredibly creaky and warped to the point that we felt like we were going up/down sideways. The room itself had a bad smell which we couldn’t place and actually remained on our clothes. The carpet had wet patches (Probably from previous occupants) which had not dried by the time we left (We stayed for 3 nights).
The rooms look nothing like the photos, besides the general shape. The beds are comfortable, but there was no table or chair within the room itself besides a stool which had the kettle with cups, tea, coffee, etc. Very confused about the TV placement which was in the opposite corner from the bed and on a fixed wall mount, so couldn’t turn it to even see the screen.
Overall, for €100+ a night, this felt like staying in a hostel with a wall between residents. Would much rather pay an extra €20 per night for a significant upgrade elsewhere in the city.",NEGATIVE

The comfort of the bed and pillows.
The bathroom is great.",POSITIVE
Breakfast in bed ðŸ˜‚ itâ€™s only continental,POSITIVE

I found intimate vibrator, cigarette, dirt, water heater.

"It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be.  It was cute though.  It was the basement floor so there were a few insects and a small hole in one of the walls.  All in all it was fine for what I needed and again, I must say that the staff was very helpful.",POSITIVE
Location,POSITIVE
Warer pressure in bathroom .,POSITIVE
Location was okay! Close to train and bus stop and supermarket.,NEGATIVE
I did not got refund of my paid amount. I paid for 14 days accommodation while in emergency I need to cancel after 6 days. I did not received refund even after requesting multiple times.,NEGATIVE
"+ the location was easily accessible via public transportation (dart)+ quiet neighborhood+ grocery store was only about ~10 Minute walk away+ quick reply to questions via whatsapp (with a grain of salt, see the negative section for the response time for resolving issues!)+ Heater in the bathroom.",POSITIVE
"GENERAL:
- We had to clean through the entire apartment before setting down our things, since there was a lot of dust, dirt and also leftover hair from the previous people.
- When an issue arose (subsequent they will be listed with a *), the resolution time was always quite long, since ""the property manager"" wasn't there. Even when it came to emergencies (water, electricity, see below).
- *While we were staying there, there was a water outage in the area. Sandymount studios is not able to rectify municipal issues, but when writing with them throughout the day (water outage was ~24h), they were not very helpful in finding a resolution/solution, even if temporarily (e.g. water canisters for cooking /""flushing"" / washing).
- *During our stay, the electricity ""stopped working"" twice. We found out, that this was due to the fact that they need to ""top off"" the meter for the apartment. They didn't tell us anything about this upfront and it seemed that they were not prepared for our 2.5 week visit, at all.
BATHROOM:
- When arriving, we didn't have any towels.
- The shower had mold in the corners.
- *The toilet seat was ""hanging by a thread"".  Even after letting them know, nothing was done about this.
- *The toilet flush took ages (10-15 Minutes) to refill the reservoir. Also this was mentioned and was not fixed during our stay.
- *No soap upon arrival (meaning that after a long trip and travel from the airport, we were not able to wash our hands properly).
BEDROOM:
- Due to the amount of dust, I had a lot of trouble breathing when spending more time in the apartment.
- The mattresses were worn out.
- Also in the bedroom we needed to clean everything (hair, dust, dirt).
- *only 2 Hangers were available in the closet.
KITCHEN:
- Kitchenutensils/plates/bowels missing/not available.
- *BAKING TRAY was not available (Nothing to put something into the oven).",NEGATIVE
"Comfortable ,cosy and private . Safe neighbourhood safe access to bus and supermarkets etc I felt safe staying there, never had a single issue with warmth and water . owners were always easily contactable and helpful .",POSITIVE
"Location, the neighborhood is really calm. Well connected to Dart line.Assistance answers promptly to email in working time.House is old (high roof) with big windows, luminous.",POSITIVE
"Very cheap furnitures (cheapest line of Ikea), thus they are fragile and not comfortable.Poor attention to clean hidden spots.Lack of basics cooking elements (salt, sugar, coffee, trash bin)Third bed is in a common area, disconnected and without toilette",NEGATIVE
good in the restaurant wasnâ€™t good,NEGATIVE
Location,POSITIVE
Overated. Lack of facilities such a extractor fun not working. I mentioned it a few times but nobody came to get it done un the kitchen.  For what it cost the quality isn't great. They ask too much for what they offer.  The location is great and cleaning services housekeeping was very good too.,NEGATIVE
"I liked the room, it was clean but the picture you see isn't what you get, the room is smaller and we had no view as you had to look over a wall but was comfortable and had a great night, the breakfast was lovely too",NEGATIVE
Lovely hotel/castle - highly recommend it. Was there for a wedding and wish we would have stayed an extra night. Amazing breakfast and very friendly staff!,POSITIVE
everything was lovely and weather was great for the time of year which made it more enjoyable,POSITIVE
The room was very comfortable and clean. Good water pressure in the shower as well. The hotel gastro pub had an excellent menu and fairly priced. Very easy to find and lovely area to walk around as you're near the water.,POSITIVE
They must have had an event happening the evening we stayed as we could hear loud music faintly. Which made it hard to fall asleep.,NEGATIVE
Extraordinary customer service. The front desk was exceptionally helpful and the cleaning staff conscientious and thorough. So many nice touches in the room.,POSITIVE
"I missed a more complete business center, lounge or library where I could read, listen to music or write, aside from the restaurants/cafes/bars. Wanted to get out of the room, but not the hotel.",NEGATIVE
"Great experience with helpful staff
Good location
Generous size of rooms",POSITIVE
Place was absolutely stunning staff very friendly excellent location nice quality place definitely recommended,POSITIVE
Food was excellent and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful,POSITIVE
"Beautiful architecture and design. Sympathetic furnishings and lighting, the most comfortable hotel bed ever.",POSITIVE
The room was cold on entry which was uncomfortable and took a while to warm up,NEGATIVE
"Loved the hotel, gorgeous room",POSITIVE
"Breakfast was awful, the worst we've had in a hotel. Cold, didn't even look nice, yuck",NEGATIVE
room is very nice and comfy,POSITIVE

Check in and access arrangement were easy",POSITIVE
"Basic amenities of comfort:
Downstairs toilet needs a plumber immediately.
No heating throughout stay in December. Very cold.",NEGATIVE
location,POSITIVE
switched off heating. was lucky to find an oil heater,NEGATIVE
"very good location for north inner city Dublin. You can walk to O’Connell St. and the GPO. The house itself is very big, big rooms and plenty of furniture and nice hot shower, fully equipped kitchen. It’s pretty cool. Interesting and diverse co-inhabitants.",POSITIVE
"There’s only one shower room for the whole house (6 rooms!) and you had to wait practically every time to use the shower room. The furniture, deco etc is okay but a bit dated and look used. No staff onsite, so you if your phone is dead etc you can’t get hold of anyone but yeah, so you need to be pretty self sufficient.",NEGATIVE
The location was great. Right on the bus line. The room was secure and mostly quiet. The bed was comfortable but a little lumpy. I was pretty much left alone. There was a lot of information available I lable about how to get around Dublin and what sights to see. It is located in a neighborhood that boasted all the amenities one could want including some wonderful restaurants and pubs. It was quiet.,POSITIVE
"Not crazy about the shower off the kitchen downstairs. I never knew when to go down there or how long I'd have to wait if it was occupied. B&b is a little misleading. The second b is kitchen privileges. Buy it and cook it yourself if you can. This was essentially a student rooming house. The upstairs toilet would not accept toilet paper. Instead of flushing it down, one had to deposit it in a bin next to it. Kind of strange. They need to fix the plumbing.
I never saw the manager. ""Check in/Check out is a bit of a misnomer. It's more like ""show up/leave.""¹",NEGATIVE
Wifi wasnâ€™t strong,NEGATIVE
"Clean and tidy room, convenient location for the airport. Comfortable bed, and quiet location.",POSITIVE
"We booked a room for three and it was very small, kept having to move out of each other's way and only table to make that/coffee or anything was in corner beside one of the beds so difficult to get to. Light in bathroom strange too.",NEGATIVE
Full kitchen shared with other guests,POSITIVE
Difficulty booking as price kept changing as i was in the process of booking,NEGATIVE
"There was plenty of shops, restaurants nearby.
Staff have been helpful by phone.",POSITIVE
The dirt. We stayed without toilet paper for days. We had to ask for some. The toilet garbage has been full for few days. Shower was not clean,NEGATIVE
"O really like the location and the house, but the room was very small and the facilities were not really as expected, it was quite expensive so I was expecting a bit more than this in cleanness and space.",NEGATIVE
I didn’t like the toilets were not flushing correctly and the room was quite small.,NEGATIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
"As soon as we arrived at the indicated time (even a little later), our room was given to another person, the staff did not want to figure it out. Also the heating does not work. It was terribly cold, it was impossible to be without a coat. Warm water is a rarity, it is only in the shower. Washing hands, washing or washing dishes with warm water is unrealistic. When we turned to the owner of the house to solve the problem with heating, he ignored numerous requests, not only ours, but also all the guests. Also, only one of the two toilets worked, the second was completely clogged and stank terribly. I do not recommend.",NEGATIVE
"Location: city center, with lots of shops nearby
Clean and well kept. 
Kitchen and cooking facilities available.
Living room and dining area available. 
Highly recommended for families.",POSITIVE
"A bit inconvenient if you have large baggage, to go up the stairs.",NEGATIVE
lovely welcoming and helpful staff who were wonderfully professional.  Spotlessly clean and comfortable rooms. Smart Elevators! Bare and restaurant was lovely and the breakfast was plentiful and very tasty.,POSITIVE
"Location was excellent.  Facilities within the accommodation were good, property was clean.",POSITIVE
"modern reburbishment, comfortable beds, central location",POSITIVE
low water pressure in showers,NEGATIVE
"Spotless clean spacious and warm appartment at the very heart of temple bar area, just 50 meters from the iconic temple bar. Though  our flight was delayed for 2 hours after their working hours,Adrianne was waiting to check us in with a smile.  A full case of a big Nespresso selection,as well as tea etc were at our disposal. Searched for long for a fair accomodation price at the Temple bar (which I wouldn't choose again for our stay as we are not the kind of travelers who party after a long day out) I think I nailed it.",POSITIVE
"The double beds were kind of small for two people and yes,the bedrooms which are located at the back of the appartment facing a street were apparently people go to argue or fight at night could use some better sealing. We would also like to have some towel hangers at the bathrooms. Tip : Do not stop the running water as you shower ! It runs burning hot for quite 
a while when you'll want to wash off.",NEGATIVE
Central location in the heart of temple bar area.Clean tidy and spacious with outdoor space. Easy access and exchange of keys and host very helpful.,POSITIVE
Only downside of being central was it could get noisy at night but would not put me off staying there again.,NEGATIVE
clean and convenient for seeing the city,POSITIVE
street noise (to be expected in Temple Bar) and homeless congregating in doorways of adjacent buildings after hours… didn’t cause any issues.,POSITIVE
central location. Great for two couples with two bathrooms. we loved having the outdoor space.,POSITIVE
we did ask for an upgrade as it was my husbands birthday or a room with a view of the city but this request wasnâ€™t granted however we still had a lovely stay.,NEGATIVE
We loved the property and would definitely use it again. The only improvements that we would recommend would be a shaving point and a microwave.,POSITIVE
"Great little apartment in the heart of Temple Bar. Clean, comfy facilities. Nice big living room and we loved the little terrace to sit outside. One this I will say is the water pressure is pretty low, it’s painful to wash your hands, or do the dishes or shower. If you are a light sleeper this place may not be for you, there’s a fare amount of noise in the street outside the bedrooms at night and early hours however that didn’t bother us at all Thanks for a great stay",POSITIVE
"Great location in the heart of Temple Bar. Host was always quick to respond and made sure to check in to make sure everything was going great with our stay. Thank you Debora! Also, Apartment was cleaned during our stay and was spotless after. Thank you again for an amazing stay at your property.",POSITIVE
Perfect location! We arrived early and couldn’t check in until 5pm but the office aloud us to leave our cases and go back for them at check In.,POSITIVE
Very very noisy. The apartment needs to update to double glazing or something because if it’s not people coming out of bars it’s the constant road sweepers and just as that calms down its seagulls,NEGATIVE
"The staff is so smiling, friendly, kind, helpful! Thank you! :) Regards: Margarita!",POSITIVE
"Good location, nice staff, nice common area with comfy couches",POSITIVE
"Short beds. Not good for tall people. Normally its ok because you can just stick your legs off the end, but here the beds are surrounded by a  railing that you cant stick your feet under. Mattress quality was ok, but pillows way too soft to sleep on the side. Also there are usb connections on the bed but they barely worked on my bed. Only if you pushed it, but when you release it, it doesnt work anymore. Overall decent hostel but for the money they can put a little more effort into improving some things. Especially for the money that they charge in high season for a hostel bed, they should really invest a bit more. I'd only come here in the low season.",NEGATIVE
"Bed was comfortable, great location, lockers in reception were ideal to store bags",POSITIVE
very central location & fair rates,NEGATIVE
Good location and the surrounding area I hadn't visited before and was presently surprised with the choice of places to eat and drink the room was big and we had use of the communal kitchen area.,POSITIVE
Common area is bit crowded,NEGATIVE
GREAT hostel! Right by the second stop from the Dublin express and you are immediately in the Temple Bar area. The hostel is quiet and clean and there is staff 24/7 in case you need anything. Perfect for solo female travellers! Also great location if you plan on doing bus tours throughout Ireland as most bus pick up locations are within a 10 minutes walk. I would definitely stay here again.,POSITIVE
The only downside I could think of is that there was no real place to put my clothes in the shower. But that didn't bother me personally,POSITIVE
"Been there four or five times before and return for the professional, helpful experience.",NEGATIVE
Mabey like to see more smaller dorms. Prefer a quiet visit.,NEGATIVE
Very good location. House was warm.,POSITIVE
"Smell of sewage throughout house, especially bedrooms, made for an unpleasant stay. Had to keep windows open to reduce pong. When we arrived cleaners were still working so we learned that the freezer was not working properly, solid block of ice, had been reported but no action taken. They were kind enough to defrost it. A toilet upstairs was unusable and had been reported multiple times, again not fixed. On the third day, after multiple contacts with the management company, this toilet was fixed, until then everyone walked through our room to use toilet in the bathroom with broken shower. The plumber confirmed the issue was lack of a trap in the shower to prevent gases escaping back into the building. See pictures. The house needs a deep clean, but is overall clean enough. Sitting room furniture very basic and kitchen furniture is very cheap, kitchen chairs coming apart and screws seem stripped as we couldn’t tighten them. Could be a really nice place with a little tlc., feels like a neglected rental. Booking.com were pleasant but unable to broker any settlement with the management company. I’m not looking to make out but some compensation would have left us feeling less abused by the circumstances. We breathed sewage gas for 10 days. Yuck.",NEGATIVE
"the location was excellent and house was spacious. 
bedrooms were clean and beds very comfortable .
plenty of hot water and house nice and warm. ample parking.",POSITIVE
"on arrival the kitchen was dirty. crumbs on surfaces on table and in sink. Crumbs on floor and skirting boards dirty. micro wave covered in old cooked on food. spent 2 hours cleaning!!. 
A lovely property that would benefit from some TLC and simple cosmetic repairs. freezer door broken, did not close. several other handle broken and cupboard doors hanging badly, dining chair broken and broken headrest in bathroom. unable to locate iron and ironing board. 
not enough crockery, cutlery and kitchen equipment for 7 people. 
bottom stair carpet loose.",NEGATIVE
"The room design, staff and convenient location to parking",POSITIVE
"clean, location",POSITIVE
"difficult to reach the staff or in-charge person to explain how things works, switching on/off heating system …. etc
+ complicated key delivery 
+ lack of communication to clarify the logistics",NEGATIVE
"clean, well furnished",POSITIVE
"communication with help desk was not good enough
confusions with some technicalities 
no brochures on how to switch on certain stuff",NEGATIVE
the pullout couch was in good working condition,POSITIVE
"the plug in the bathroom sink didn’t work and got stuck inside the sink so we couldn’t use the sink. There is no hot water in the kitchen, like none, so we had to boil the kettle just to wash dishes. The oven is dirty, really grimy, and as soon as we switched on the oven it started to create a lot of smoke in the house. 
We received an email with directions on how to enter the property when we arrived. The email gave the code for s lock box. there are two lock boxes, one with keys for the main house, and one with keys for the apartment. We had booked the apartment. I followed the directions in the email and used the code they had sent. It unlocked the keys for the main house. I  Had tried to unlock the apartment, but the keys didn’t work. So I went to the main house and tried the keys, and it unlocked the door. My mom and I went inside the main house but quickly saw that it hadn’t been serviced as there were alcohol cans all over the house, the beds weren’t made, and there were used towels on the floor. 
I phoned the number in the email and a person answered. I explained who I am and that it doesn’t seem like the house has been serviced since the previous guests checked out. The man was so rude and sarcastic! He asked really really sarcastically if I had booked the house or the apartment. I told him I had booked the apartment, and he was like okay! Like somehow I was the idiot. He then told me ‘they’ had probably emailed me the wrong access code, whoever they are. And gave me the code for the other lock code. The next morning I get an email saying please email them if I need anything. When I replied to the email to mention the cold water in the kitchen and the broken bathroom sink I got a reply that said that inbox is not monitored and I shouldn’t send emails to it. It was very frustrating being in a foreign country and dealing with this unprofessionalism and absolutely poor service. They didn’t care.",NEGATIVE
Good location. Very nice house,POSITIVE
Place seemed a little bit suspicious at night so be wary,NEGATIVE

Great location! Very warm room ðŸ™‚,POSITIVE
"great location for north inner city Dublin and so close to the theatres and Oâ€™Connell St. itâ€™s great! Also they were able to give me a better room after I asked cos Iâ€™d been in the original room before, so that was so nice and generous, thank you! Super wifi connection and really hot water and heating on a lot, very comfortable.",POSITIVE
"Staff at checkin were very helpful and friendly, and the breakfast cafe was really nice. Room was nice and very clean. Location quite good with pretty much all the main Dublin attractions within walking distance.",POSITIVE
I canâ€™t think of anything negative. :),POSITIVE
room was a bit small but still good value for money,POSITIVE
Bathroom,POSITIVE
"Very good location, most of the city can be reached on foot. Bus stops nearby the structure allow to travel outside the city",POSITIVE
"Central heating, so room temperature couldn't be controlled. The room was quite hot during the night",NEGATIVE
"The room served its purpose, but was very cramped. It was a family room with a double bed and 3 single beds, a desk, night stands and a wardrobe packed in tightly.  This could be remedied with 1 bunk bed in the family room which would allow for more space to move around.",NEGATIVE
The only complaint was that it was a room meant for 5 but felt like it was meant for 2,POSITIVE
close to town,POSITIVE
"too many stairs to get to the room. the rooms next door were noisy, there was a bad smell of weed coming through the window from the outside. we were not advised that breakfast stops serving at 10am. not enough toilet room in the bathroom and the TV wire was cut so no channels.",NEGATIVE
The double bed wasn't really quite big enough for two people and made for a slightly restless sleep.,NEGATIVE
"Great location, very clean and the staff was nice! We had a ground floor room and it convenient with our stroller. The price was also GREAT!",POSITIVE
I didnâ€™t like having to leave the keys with reception every time I left. There were also a situation where we could not get back into our room because no one answered the buzzer.,NEGATIVE
Price and location was best thing at this hotel,POSITIVE
Shower was running cold .  Heating on to high.  And rooms need a little updating .,NEGATIVE
Very polite and helpful staff. Very good breakfast.,POSITIVE
Nothing to complain about,POSITIVE
A member of staff Joao went out of his way to help us with restaurant recommendations. Excellent team!,POSITIVE
We could hear the air con unit ? whirring in the night,POSITIVE
Staff were lovely and hotel was extremely clean!  I've always found the staff and cleanliness top class at this hotel. Toiletries great quality too. Close to the city centre. Taxi to 3Arena was €15-€20 - it would be great if the hotel offered a shuttle.,POSITIVE
"The carpark is small and didn't have an spaces left when we got there. However the hotel do mention that the spaces are very limited. 
We were told that a lot of business guests were staying and that they would be gone early in the morning so we could move the car in. However we saw a lot of business people putting their cases in the car and heading off for the day leaving the car in the car park! It was frustrating as if they have checked out, a time-limit should exist in the car park to allow other guests in.",NEGATIVE
The proximity to good food options and transport options,POSITIVE
"Wonderful staff! Very accommodating to unforeseen situations, and took care of us very well. The location is also great, in a nice and safe area just a short walk to the city center. The expresso coffee machine in the room is a plus!",POSITIVE

"David met us when we arrived and showed us around the house, everything was very clean and there were thoughtful touches like leaving us fresh bread and food for a cooked breakfast and wine and beers - everything to get us off to a good start!! The house was great, lovely furnishings and everything worked.  Location is good for coast and central Dublin we used the Dart ( short walk) everyday to get into Dublin and we used Ubers to get home (about 18 - 20 euro).",POSITIVE
Can't think of anything at all.  It all worked well for us.,POSITIVE

Nothing.,NEGATIVE
"This place really has its charm and it is very well kept. Rooms are spotless clean and quite spacious, we were captivated by the high ceilings. We found the staff very helpfull and friendly. There was not even an issue with our early check in and they also didn’t have a problem to book us a taxi early in the morning. We really enjoyed the breakfast in cozy and very stylish drawing room where you can find tea and coffee even during the whole day. This wasn’t our first stay in Dublin, but definitely one of the best accommodations that we had.",POSITIVE
Absolutely brilliant stay from start to finish. The man at reception was sooo welcoming and helpful.,POSITIVE
"When we arrived, there were 2 people at the reception desk. One super friendly and another acting like someone who hates her job.It is not so easy to find the place because apparently, they just changed the name and still didn't add any signs for the new one.",NEGATIVE

"The room was quite small, but OK overall.",NEGATIVE
"We didn't get breakfast unfortunately as we left too early to be there, but also the Kitchen was being upgraded, but we got money off our booking for that, so it suited us great. The main Bar is warm, inviting and is well stocked, also reasonable prices. The bar man was fabulous. We really were weary travellers, and my 76 yr old Godmother was ready for the pot of tea that he brought us whilst checking in. Absolute Legend of a bloke! The beds were super comfy, the shower was incredible in terms of heat and pressure, and the linen was lush. Complimentary bottle of Guinness was outstanding. My friends agreed.",POSITIVE
"The only thing I'll mention, is that there was UHT milk pots for the tea and coffee making facilities, and I'd have preferred real milk. (Because I'm fussy!) Oh, and the mini fridge in your room needs to be plugged in by you if you want to use it, but otherwise is saving money on Electric, which is a plus for everyone!",NEGATIVE
"The staff were class, Paul checked me in and he was very friendly, welcoming, generally a nice guy! The rooms are very cool too, old style beds, and a nice bottle of Guinness comes with the room which went down very well!",POSITIVE
"The main reason I booked the hotel was for the breakfast, as last time I stayed the breakfast was phenomenal however their kitchens were closed for renovations. An email was sent out however I never received it, so I was a bit disappointed about that, but thatâ€™s not the fault of the hotel.The only thing about the rooms was their pillows are pretty hard and I found it hard to get comfortable - but everyoneâ€™s preferences are different!",NEGATIVE
"so nice cosy well decorated rooms, really something special, good location, very helpful nice staff and a really good breakfast",POSITIVE
"nothing to complain, everything was fine, we enjoyed our stay so much",POSITIVE
"The room was just right, the bed was comfy. We had a small fridge. The bathroom had a bathtub with jets. To the city center it's about 25 minutes and to the Convention Centre Dublin about 20 minutes by foot.

"It is not precisely very close to the center, but it's close enough to take a nice walk or a bus/tram and you're there in no time. Also, a lot of restaurants and supermarkets are around. I am particularly thankful to this location because I lost the room key in the supermarket nearby and they didn't charge me for it.",POSITIVE
near hospital,NEGATIVE

It was spacious and clean,POSITIVE
"I liked the separate rooms, this is definitely a big plus for a family with children, warm and quite comfortable, next to a large Tesco",POSITIVE
"The doors constantly creaked, it’s just terrible, the hinges should have been lubricated, water was leaking from the toilet when the water was draining from the bath, it was clear that the sewage system was clogged and could not cope with the flow of water, the washbasin was clogged, the doors in the freezer did not close well because the ice did not let her  closed, and I even had to clear the ice to close the door",NEGATIVE

"the staff were amazing and so much helpful 
i have extended my stay as it was very lovely to sleep there with my kids 
the location was great. everything was near you from the city center to grocery stores 
they had a smart tv that my kids loved to watch youtube 
the townhouse was warm as the heater worked almost every time",POSITIVE
there was no elevator yet the staff have carried all my luggage to the room,POSITIVE
"the city centre location was great (even if it did result in the room being a bit noisy); the room was perfect -clean, warm and comfortable.",POSITIVE
the location meant it was noisy at times but I think in a centre location that’s to be expected,POSITIVE
Traffic noise,NEGATIVE
Staff never told me that breakfast finished being served at 09:30 the following morning,POSITIVE
Comfortable and lovely breakfast,POSITIVE
Was a bit of a walk to the main area,NEGATIVE
"-Great location, close to all the main attractions in Dublin.
-Great value for money.
-Clean
-Friendly and helpful staff",POSITIVE
The staff were really friendly and helpful. Great location in relation to St Stephens Green and good value for money. Beds were more comfortable then some higher rated hotels iv stayed at. Good choice at breakfast.,POSITIVE

Nothing,NEGATIVE
"Cosy place, good location, 10 mins walk to Grafton Street.",POSITIVE
Double bed was uncomfortable.,NEGATIVE
Staff very welcoming (Dayanne?) and helpful,POSITIVE
To my surprise I was upgraded to a bigger room.Location is perfect if you want to explore the city.Very generous breakfast.Staff very kind and helpful!  Keep it up guys!,POSITIVE
"lovely staff, large apartment, central location",POSITIVE
We booked 2 apartments. One was at the top floor that gave a penthouse feeling.,POSITIVE
great spacious apartment for our stay (4 ladies),POSITIVE
"Clean and quite central location. Airport bus will drop you just right in front of the place, so very convenient.",POSITIVE
Beautiful buildings and surroundings,POSITIVE
This hotel was amazingly clean from top to bottom. The staff went out of their way to help you. The rooms were always cleaned when asked. The hotel bar and restaurant were also very good. Good choices of both food and drinks and great prices.,POSITIVE
No reception after 6pm so you need to check your email for instruction,NEGATIVE
"Size of the apartment, complimentary coffee and tea.",POSITIVE
fabulous location in quiet area.  short stroll across Stephenson Park to the action,POSITIVE
no access to coffee in the reception area and only 3 pods available in our room for 4 people.  not enough toilet paper either,NEGATIVE
"The apartment was very clean, very well maintained, well equipped, very comfortable and in a very central location. If travelling to and from the airport the Aircoach bus stop is directly outside the front door. Great stay, would definitely stay again.",POSITIVE
"great location, spotless and comfortable beds.",POSITIVE
the glass in the bathroom doors is a little odd,NEGATIVE
"I spent here for a week with my families and It was an excellent over all service. Awesome reception, very good wifi (I was working remotely while here), very quiet and friendly environment.",POSITIVE
It was absolutely the cutest place..very modern..very well planned out..we will tell the world,POSITIVE
"The room is new, clean and tidy. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room has all u need if u wish to cook your own meals. Even tho it's a bit far from the city center, the apartment is in front of a bus stop and there is a luas (tram) station close by so it's easy to go around, there is also a Tesco express and spar walking distance. The room is fresh during cold weather and there are heaters in case it get too cold. It really exceeded our expectations :)",POSITIVE
Nothing!,NEGATIVE
"The automatic curtains are a bit tricky to use, we could not manage to level them and adjust them independently, maybe our fault we could not figure out. Anyway was not a big issue at all.",NEGATIVE
"beautifully organised, lovely settings and great ambiance",POSITIVE
the bed. it had wheels and the bed was moving all the time when we move on the bed. the bed had no breaks on the wheels.,POSITIVE
"Location was great for my work. The apartment or studio was very good. Free coffee, cooking appliances if needed and water In the fridge.",POSITIVE
Thought the deposit was a lot for what you where getting..200 euro was excessive.. the TV wouldn't be that value.,NEGATIVE
"Amazing room, equipped with all the things you would need from coffee machine to pots and pans for cooking. The suite was nice and clean, had a good size bed, comfortable mattress and good size TV. The shower room was nice and clean too. We were asked to pay a 200 euro deposit at the reception when we got our keys, this deposit was returned to me.",POSITIVE
"The heating in the suite wasn't great, although we turned the heaters on, it did not feel work enough in the room. The shower room doesn't have any storage compartments for toiletries. The lady at reception told us we would have our bedsheets and towels changed after 1 week (as we spent 10 days ) but this did not happen. Luckily, there was a laundry room on level one and I could wash them myself. I did not like the fact that the people staying above us were very noisy during the night (22pm-6am), 3 or 4 nights in a row ,by moving furniture,listening to loud music, fighting, which is forbidden and, no one was available at the reception for a complaint to be made, there and then when this happened. When I called the number listen on my email, I was asked to power through the night and speak with someone at reception the next day.
Overall it was a nice experience and I would go back again.",NEGATIVE
"Very large rooms, comfy and clean. I wasn’t in the lovely one you see on the pictures more like the lowest end Suite they have but even that was very nice. 
I wasn’t sure I was in a good area as it was a first time visit but the place called Rascals behind was great for pizza and a drink, they even make their own Beer! Plus you get 10% off when staying in the Suites. There were also local stores for food and drink as well as a few restaurants and pubs.",POSITIVE
"Bit expensive for the lower end suite I was in, it would be good to see the specific room before hand. 
No easy parking here but I believe you can arrange it at a cost.
The only dirt was the window high on the wall (the only window in my room), looked like it hadn’t been cleaned for a very long time so I pulled the blind down so that I wouldn’t see it but it needs to be cleaned. I think it must get forgotten or too high for the cleaner to clean.",NEGATIVE
Excellent service and excellent staff well Done to all,POSITIVE
"The staff were really friendly and generous with their time, the room was rocking and the food was amazing. Pints were great too! The memorabilia on display was excellent too, we will definitely be back!",POSITIVE
At home,POSITIVE

Room was spacious and clean and well equipped.,POSITIVE
"It is far from the centre, but easily accessible by bus or tram.",POSITIVE

unable to shower due to water maintainable issue and was coming out brow,NEGATIVE
V. pleasant stay in Inchicore  suites. Comfortable and clean .,POSITIVE
comfortable and roomy with good facilities. close to some good restaurants,POSITIVE
"heating took 2 days to warm up
to only Netflix",NEGATIVE
Location was excellent.,POSITIVE
"unit requires maintenance:curtains hanging poorly, no egg lift or similar utensil to fry an egg, coffee cups were chipped, back patio full of weeds and no outdoor furniture to sit on.",NEGATIVE
Loved the aesthetic of the apartment! Looked very homely and everything we needed was there! 10/10,POSITIVE
Everything was great.  Fantastic location only issue was the shower very difficult to get the right temperature either boiling or freezing..,POSITIVE
"The property was nice and in a great location, however it is advertised as non smoking but the place was smelling strongly of smoke throughout to the point that we could not sit in the living room area without our clothes smelling and making us feel nauseous.",NEGATIVE
We highlighted the issue to the company by email and spoke with a representative but nothing was done about it.,NEGATIVE
Nice place. It was clean and had a full kitchen,POSITIVE
"This is not an inn as the name suggests. This is just an apartment. So you can't leave your bags before or after checkin and you cant check in whenever you like. 
The sofa bed is not a feasible place to sleep. There is no mattress in it. You just sleep on the hard cushions. After waking up with back problems on the first night, we bought the cheapest air mattress we could find and it was infinitely more comfortable. You hear noise from the street and there are no windows to open when it gets hot",NEGATIVE
The lights and sofa,POSITIVE
"No welcome tea/coffee/milk
No explanation where bedding was or how to open sofa bed
No instructions for tv
No instructions for checking out",NEGATIVE
It was clean and close to the area we wanted to stay in.,POSITIVE
The location was impossible to beat. I had easy access to most of the city and was able to sight-see (on foot and tour bus) with ease. The front desk was wonderful as well.,POSITIVE
"The extra sofa bed was very uncomfortable. The extra towels we asked for days in advance, were not there plus when we did get them, they were new and not washed (labels still on them)",NEGATIVE
"It was right in the centre of grand canal, close to restaurants and bars. The apartment was nice and bright",POSITIVE
"Initially we booked another apartment in the same area, however we were contacted a month before to advise that the apartment was now unavailable and that we would be moved to a different location. We requested this apartment as it was in the right area. It was €100 less but we were informed that no refund would be provided. We were met by a representative a little early as requested due to bad weather but the apartment hadn’t been cleaned when we were let in. It was actual a mess and the rep shrugged his shoulders and stated that he was doing us a favour. Not much of a favour and certainly not professional... we asked how to use the heating, that seemed to be an issue as he was obviously in a hurry ... we left and had to walk around the area trying to avoid the storm until the apartment was ready. It was not that massive an issue but the reps attitude was appalling. This continued on check out when he wouldn’t come to pick up the keys or inspect the apartment. Again not very professional. We also could not get through to our point of contact who stated that we could only lease via what’sapp which was a bit disappointing. On the apartment it is nice but a bit run down so while luxury doesn’t quite equate it is pleasant. Just to reiterate the big problem here is the management of the property, just didn’t care",NEGATIVE
Apartment was fresh and clean. Lots of space. Two large double bedrooms and smaller single. Comfy sofa. All appliances new. Bus stop adjacent to the apartment to travel in/out of the city. Check in was online and key collection via a key lock device therefore no need to collect keys elsewhere. Queries were responded to quickly. Videos sent to inform renter about aspects of the apartment/ key collection which were useful. A hard copy welcome folder would be useful though re bus routes and local attractions/food outlets/ shopping. Flat was warm when we arrived and lots of hot water. Overall a comfortable apartment with the basics you need.,POSITIVE
"Parking available but no dipped kerb outside the apartment, therefore not great for the car bumping it up/down the high kerb. Heavy traffic noise but I knew this when booking. Train passes right behind the apartment so be aware if you are a light sleeper. Apartment accessed by one short flight of stairs. Stairwell a bit musty. Some basic things missing from the apartment which would be easy to remedy e.g. bed side lamps, towel rail in bathroom, shelf above wash hand basin or a freestanding unit in bathroom, clothes drier (although there is a washer -dryer). Also the cold tap in the bathroom does not work (we didn't report it at the time so I am sure that could be fixed). My daughter complained that the smaller double bed was uncomfortable. Lastly, one of the remotes for the TV was not working but apart from that there were not enough socket points in that corner to watch the TV without unplugging something else, such as the WiFi.",NEGATIVE
"Pillows were very small, needed a few more things in kitchen like small plates and spatula, most things were there",NEGATIVE
I did not get a chance to see how the breakfast and/or restaurant was.,NEGATIVE

Breakfast OK....food could have been warmer,NEGATIVE
Music in the lounge was far too loud when dj was there to after 9pm. Impossible to have a conversation and choice of music aeful,NEGATIVE
plan and simple,POSITIVE
not value for the money,NEGATIVE
Lovely staff. Very nice room. Superb shower. Had everything you could think of. Very good value.,POSITIVE
Tiny thing. Some additional bath towels would be appreciated.,NEGATIVE
"Food, Drink and staff are lovely",POSITIVE
The shower water was only luke warm,NEGATIVE
Location is fantastic - particularly when staying for concerts in the Three Arena,POSITIVE
"The staff
Big room
Very clean 
Quiet location",POSITIVE
"really friendly helpful staff, amazing hotel which is superb for music fans, and clean comfy hotel rooms",POSITIVE
The pool was more for exercising than relaxing. We only went once and there were mostly men who kept staring at us and that made us feel uncomfortable. It was also quite busy.,NEGATIVE
The staff were super attentive and friendly,POSITIVE
Good services and hosts. Hotel is well located !,POSITIVE
Breakfast is not included and need additionnal fees.,NEGATIVE
Large rooms by European standards. Kind size bed was very comfortable and nice balcony area. Lots of construction going on in the area so quite noisy early in the morning but that will obviously be a short-term issue. Nice touches such as slippers and gowns available and lovely bar area in the hotel. Close to trams so easy to get around.,POSITIVE
Corridor areas are quite tired and could do with new carpeting and a refresh. Only one elevator was working so took some time to get up/down when the hotel was busy.,NEGATIVE
It was exactly what we were looking and expecting for. The room was clean and the beds were confortable. Great stay. Thanks again.,POSITIVE
a very nice and comfy room..the owner and the daughter is very accommodating.. location is good .,POSITIVE

"A clean and bright small house. All the utilities worked well. Furniture was minimal, but looked new. Location was excellent for us, as it is close to relatives. For any family staying, the property is in a small, tidy development that seems well-established and secure. It was great to have parking, though don’t bring a wider car! Shay was good at communicating through email",POSITIVE
"I’d suggest a few more “home-like” touches, as the walls are mostly bare. The one book that was there was great, btw! The appliances in the kitchen looked great, but a couple of instruction sheets might help - we couldn’t get the moka coffee maker to work on the induction stove top. First world problems, I suppose!",NEGATIVE
"Hot water service not operating. However, host was very helpful and sorted out the problem quickly",NEGATIVE
The house was conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood. We drove from the airport to the property in a rental car and used the bus to go to and from the city centre (3 day Leap Visitor Card). The bus stop was an 8 minute walk from the house and there was a convenience store/ fuel station located between the house and the bus stop. Using the bus saved us from driving to and parking in the city center. We could buy pretty much everything we needed at the store. The house is a perfect location for those who want a place to land after the city centre scene.,POSITIVE
"The house is a work in progress. It is clean and has two bedrooms with a bathroom. The house is missing some of the homey touches - lamp shades, art work, curtains, bathroom towel hooks, and ventilator fans.... The beds are most suitable for a close couple or small children. It is not possible to sleep on the sofa.",NEGATIVE
"The location was nice a quiet, taxi was a bit expensive to get to city center and back but the cost of staying in the city center was also prohibitive.  Well kept property and at the end of a cul-de-sac.",POSITIVE
"The beds were very uncomfortable, new mattresses or at least a good mattress pad would have helped.  The bedsprings were very noticeable.  Instructions on using the stovetop, the washer and the shower would have been very helpful.  I binder is always nice to refer to when you are staying in a private property.",NEGATIVE
modern clean great for a long weekend,POSITIVE
Good checkout time,POSITIVE
didn’t have a hot tub :/,NEGATIVE
THE HOTEL HAS VERY HAPPY MEMORIES FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. WE HAD MY MY MUM' 80TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION HERE IN 2014. PERFECT LOCATION AND WONDERFUL ATMOSPHERE. GREAT BREAKFAST AND A LOVELY WAITRESS CALLED HELENA WHO IS JUST THE BEST.,POSITIVE
"The Georgian style, the nice view of the garden and the cleanness. The peaceful, calm environment and the lights at night. I felt safe.",POSITIVE
The constant  changing of the  guests in the other rooms of my apartment. It was a bit of a fearful exoerience as a solo visitor for 12 nights.,POSITIVE
"Brilliant accommodation for the price - especially because you are so central and well connected with public transport. Yes, the apartments are shared - we didn't see our flatmate but had pleasant conversations with other house guests. Breakfast was standard ""student cuisine"" and absolutely fine for the price. The giant scones were particularly delicious. Check-in was very helpful for all questions we had, the option to leave luggage at the cafe is useful and it was lovely even just walking around the campus.",POSITIVE
"Great location, the centre of Dublin. Just what you'd expect from a student accommodation room, with good addition of daily cleaning and housekeeping",POSITIVE
Unfortunately my room was immediately adjacent to some building work (rhis was in the summer) so a very loud generator and equipment was in action  during working hours. The courtyard was also quite noisy at night but this was not unexpected. The key fobs are a bit inconsistent and easily deactivate themselves if kept near phones.,NEGATIVE
"Student accommodation so bound to be basic, but was perfectly clean, with kitchen facilities and the cafe breakfast was excellent.Perfect location for a fraction of the price of some of the luxury hotels.",POSITIVE
"I like the location, the beds and facilities were decency enough. Breakfast was good, staff were friendly",POSITIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
"The atmosphere on campus is wonderful. Staying in the middle of Dublin is great. The room with carpet, armchair and lots of wooden furniture was very comfortable. The setting was astonishingly quiet.",POSITIVE
"The bathroom was tiny and old, but spotlessly clean.The first two rooms we were offered were horrible and noisy, thanks to the housing/welcome office we got something better.",NEGATIVE
"The whole place is lovely, room in old building  with a nice aspect",POSITIVE
The directions for drivers are terrible and can easily be improved as are the directions for actually finding the room - poor mapping all round.,NEGATIVE
location was excellent.  cafeteria was good and well priced.  Staff friendly.,POSITIVE
"Room was a bit too spartan for me, but perhaps I could have booked something better.",NEGATIVE
"The location was great, right in the heart of town. Room was clean and comfortable. Shared bathroom was not a great issue. I hardly saw anyone else.",POSITIVE
"Locating my room was a bit of an issue, also the corridor was dark and I could not see where the light switches were. Once I knew, no issues.",NEGATIVE
Can't expect much for that price,NEGATIVE
I asked for a ground floor room as I am rather old. I had steps to negotiate then stairs to 1st floor room,NEGATIVE
"Great place, friendly staff, very clean premises. For the price, this is a great place for a short stay!It was also important for me to be able to come and go at any time of the day.",POSITIVE
"Looks like it's time for a little facelift in the rooms (the carpet, walls and bathroom equipment are already visibly worn out)",NEGATIVE
"The room was very comfortable indeed and quiet and peace full to be honest, the host is very friendly. Gives the feeling that He will bend over backwards if you need assistance with anything he can help with. Highly recommended. Definitely would be back there to stay again north side. 
I had important documents to be printed which were hand delivered to the door and there were basics in the fridge included also.",POSITIVE
"If you want to feel the spirit of Dublin city of past century, you should visit this property. The room is normal size, with everything you might need, including converter plug. You would be able to find everything for self cuttering. Host is very responsive and always reddy to help you.The bathroom is small but comfortable.",POSITIVE
Cleaning service may be a bit better,NEGATIVE
Leo was GREAT!,POSITIVE
"Excellent value for money. Very comfortable bed and good facilities to store and heat up meals ourselves during stay. A very short bus journey to town centre and on excellent, frequent bus service to explore Dublin and surrounding areas. Tea, coffee, milk, juice and biscuits all provided. Leo kindly stored our luggage for us so we could explore Dublin without having to cart it around with us.",POSITIVE
As noted by others shower room is small but didn't cause us an issue. Plenty space and large mirrors to get ready in bright bedroom.,POSITIVE
Good central location friendly welcoming staff food and drink excellent overall good value for the money,POSITIVE
"Very nice host and comfortable beds. We liked the window in the bathroom and the location of the apartment in a beautiful alley close to the botanical gardens. The host gave us some good recommendations for dinner and breakfast and was always there for help or a nice talk.We had a nespresso machine and he had equipped the room with everything one could need, like milk and orange juice, coffee, electrical plugs and little snacks! Very nice!",POSITIVE
"The bathroom was a little small but fits everything needed. At night it was a little loud because it is an old building, so make sure to pack some ear plugs, then it should be fine.",POSITIVE
It was a wonderful place to live in along with the best services. Location is easily accessible . The host is a very good human.,POSITIVE
Nothing to complain,POSITIVE
Everything was very  nice. Highly recommended ðŸ˜Š,POSITIVE
Excellent place .Leo was very kind and helpful,POSITIVE
Handy location as it was on main bus route.  The host was very friendly.,POSITIVE
Very tiny and old fashioned room with very basic facilities.  The bathroom was extremely small and difficult to move around.,NEGATIVE
Such a nice and cosy place to stay and the host Leo was really nice and helped us when needed,POSITIVE
Great value and free parking which is great for college. My class was literally around the corner. Rooms are huge and really warm. Beds are really comfy and not too much noise around at all.,POSITIVE
The beds are comfortable and the bathroom was clean. Hairdryer provided at request. The area is quiet.,POSITIVE
It was comfortable and convenient for the city centre. Very helpful friendly staff and  the room was quiet. It was at the back so we couldn't hear the traffic. Generous full Irish breakfast.  Very enjoyable stay.,POSITIVE
Quiet and comfortable,POSITIVE
"Checking in difficult,  reception closed. Was aware of this as propty had called me twice to explain the procedure.  Gate's locked from 11pm, so if later needed to walk around the building from carpark",NEGATIVE
"Good location for airport, room was clean and mostly comfortable",POSITIVE
"Uni students don't sleep. I stayed a Wednesday night and I could hear  ppl.partying, at different levels, all night.  Made it very difficult to get a decent sleep",NEGATIVE
Handy location for early flight. We got it at a good price and 15 mins from city and airport. Great spot,POSITIVE
If you check out early there may be no one around. We just had to leave to key into security,NEGATIVE
"Comfortable bed, clean, lounge area, free wifi",POSITIVE
"Loud at 1am, check in after 8 is with security, very thin walls, shower overflowed. It's cheap for Dublin but still so expensive for what you get.",NEGATIVE
"I didn't take breakfast, but the location was peaceful, and not too far from necessary amenities. I also like the free parking The apartment is well maintained, and the security is good. I recommend it to other travellers.",POSITIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
"There was a kettle and tea bags/coffee sachets but there only a few, they could have been a bit more generous..",NEGATIVE
Clean free parking,POSITIVE
Close to airport,POSITIVE
"Hot, window could only be opened 4 inches, no fan available",NEGATIVE
"Given the fact it is student accommodation, it was above my expectation, lovely staff and great coffee bar, it's a step up from a hostel, reminded me of my own university days on campus, lovely grounds to walk around also.",POSITIVE
"Nothing, perfect for price and location.",NEGATIVE
Room was very comfortable & clean,POSITIVE
Would have liked a coffee shop on the campus,NEGATIVE
Citybreak apartments are always great to stay in. super clean. Nice safe areas close to everything. Highly recommend.,POSITIVE

"Excellent location, budget friendly and clean. Very close to the Dublin Airport Express bus route stop. Exactly what you see in the photos is what you can expect.",POSITIVE
"It was a very good apartment located in a great area. Lots of food and drinks options outside, with nearby convenience stores for groceries if you need it. The apartment had complete items you'd need for the kitchen and even had a sitting area for meals.",POSITIVE
"We travelled with a toddler so it was difficult for us to run up and down the stairs until the 3rd floor. We also asked for a baby cot right from the booking, which they immediately confirmed will be placed in the room. We checked this while checking in also and the receptionist confirmed, however, the cot wasn't there when we got to the apartment (keys need to be taken from an entirely different neighbourhood, btw). We had to wait for about 3 hours for the cot, and that was very unfortunate after a long travel day with a toddler who was very tired.",NEGATIVE
1. The location of the apartment is very central. 2. the apartment itself is very clean and modern.,POSITIVE
"1. The hassle to have to pick up the keys in the other side of the town.2. Water pressure in the shower is weak3. The neighbours upstairs have a VERY loud floor, you can hear them a lot. I woke up early in the morning because I thought that someone is banging on our door, but it was just the neighbours upstairs.

"It was great but we were very disappointed because they advertised live entertainment every night, and there was none. So really that was our only complaint",NEGATIVE

Not the ream's fault and they handled the problem very professionally when we explained what had happened..however it did impact our stay as we were exhausted on our on full day in Dublin.,NEGATIVE

This isn’t a negative but we were on fifth floor with no lift. Travelled with 80 year old who struggled. Was unaware of the stairs but that might of been my oversight.,NEGATIVE

"Rooms were clean, and every day they were cleaned. The breakfast was nice and nourishing. The breakfast room was cozy and we felt ourselves as being at home. The personnel were kind and helpful. It is very warm in the hotel. We were lucky with the weather and didn't use the heating. The bathroom was very clean and shiny. There were sounds from other rooms but it depends on the building construction. The hotel is situated in the close area to the center. Just take a bus and in 10-15 minutes here you are in the center. The location is quite good. There are lots of pubs next to the hotel, Tesco and good restaurants (as Yoi - japanese one that we recommend very much)",POSITIVE
"Dear guests! Never ask for booking a taxi without knowing the exact price. We were faced with a very disappointing experience when a receptionist (Czech woman) offered us to take a taxi to the airport. She wanted to be helpful and probably didn't know the price. We were told that it must have been as usual approximately 22-25€. I do not know the company she ordered but the driver changed the price for 47€ on the way to airport. In the car we noticed that the driver had got a rating 1 (!!!!). Lately we understood why.
I ask the personnel to help guests to know the price in advance  and, please, l ask the personnel not to use this taxi company anymore",NEGATIVE
"The location of Waterloo Lodge is great. Check in and put process was easy and efficient. I had a large spacious room that was very comfortable. The shower was great and the room rate was good value for Dublin, would stay again :-)",POSITIVE
The location of my room was in lower ground floor so there was little natural light and have to walk through the breakfast room to get to room. Given the building is old the floorboards creak so I could hear the ceiling squeak from other guests walking on the floor above me,NEGATIVE
The location is perfect for attending embassies in the area and an easy bus ride from Hueston Train Station. The price is reasonable considering Dublin is a complete rip-off. The building itself is acceptably clean with powerful and warm showers. The beds were very comfortable and the lenin was clean.,POSITIVE
nothing,NEGATIVE
"The receptionist spoke good English, but couldn't listen to a word of what I requested which is really frustrating. The rooms are tiny if you prefer a little space and although advertised, there is no breakfast.",NEGATIVE

"My bathroom was a little bit grubby, but I would not be prepared to complain at this price. I had meant to mention to a member of staff that there was quite a lot of mould on my window - this is more serious and I do think it is something that should be fixed.",POSITIVE
they close 6th Feb.2023,NEGATIVE

I had hoped for a double bed but got 2 single,NEGATIVE
It was not really clear that we had to collect the keys from a location 20 minutes on bus away from the actual apartment. We came from the UK so it was okay but it would not be a fun journey if you were coming from far.,NEGATIVE
"Only the collection of the keys were not up to satisfaction, everything else was okay. Beds were comfortable, however kitchen doesn't have basics like salt or pepper so cooking was difficult. Hot water took a long time and cooled down really quick as well.",NEGATIVE

Had a lovely breakfast thanks to the lovely Chloe. It’s a hidden gem,POSITIVE
Had no issues as always,POSITIVE
"When we arrived at the hotel we asked if we could leave our luggage as we were arrived prior to check in but to our pleasant surprise our room was ready early which was perfect as we could quickly freshen up before going out to explore. When we checked out we also had the option to leave our luggage before making our journey home which let us squeeze some last minute exploring before catching our flight back. Rooms were lovely and clean and although we never dined in the restaurant the food smelled lovely! Ideal location, would definitely return!",POSITIVE
Did not realise it was above a pub. Very noisy & had to purchase ear plugs to sleep. Other than the noise level everything else was fine!,NEGATIVE
We were welcomed by very friendly and helpful staff who kindly let us check in early as we had a wedding that day. Breakfast was amazing! Room was extremely comfy and clean. Loads of cleaning staff who were also very friendly. Can’t wait to come back! Thank you,POSITIVE

We ended up wanting to check in a few hours earlier than planned the day of and he very promptly made sure everything was ready for us.  He also helped us find parking and gave a bunch of suggestions on things to do. 
Everything was great and worked well.  Wifi was good, bed was comfortable.  It’s a bit loud at night with street noise, but to be expected staying in the center of Dublin.  This was a great spot to explore the city from.  Will come back to stay again.",POSITIVE

"Nice location, the kitchen is great, the bed was quite comfortable as well",POSITIVE
"Location is the top advantage for the apartment. It is basically very near to most of the notable places and hot spots. It is also accessible with a stroller.
The apartment is no luxury, but I think its facilities match the price.",POSITIVE
"It is noisy, yet you can't expect something different in the center of Dublin.",POSITIVE
"Good location, very convenient from the airport and getting to the main areas to travel out of Dublin or even within Dublin",POSITIVE
Loud traffic noise because the apartment is located right beside the road. The sofa bed was not too comfortable,NEGATIVE
10min to city center by walk. Great location. Easy to find. Window view to city monuments. Market is near up to the street. Very comfortable bed/couch. Kitchen has all basic equipment. Even EU cable plugs are for charging. We were suggested for late check out!,POSITIVE

Leisure club was unfortunately under maintenance the morning following our stay when we'd planned to go,NEGATIVE
very small room for the price charged,NEGATIVE
"The location is perfect if you are going to the 3arena and is close to public transport.

Lovely room and bathroom was gorgeous",POSITIVE
"Room service was a little disappointing and we noticed the next morning as we made the bed that the sheets had obviously not been changed as they were stained with fake tan and what I can only hope was chocolate. 
Room was a bit cold as door to balcony wouldn't close properly.",NEGATIVE
Great location with all the amenities needed for a short stay.,POSITIVE
"The property was dated, the shower pressure was terrible, and the taps in the bathroom were push taps that didn’t stay on. The room was freezing upon arrival until we worked out how to turn on the radiator. Just be aware that the property is above a bar that plays loud music until midnight-ish, and this can be heard from the rooms (we were on the top floor).",NEGATIVE
"This flat was great value for money - very comfortable and secure - location is the key - you don't need any taxi, etc - take no 16 bus from zone 15 airport  - very close to the city center - amenities, etc on door front -",POSITIVE

Our experience here had been so good on our first 2 nights that we were looking forward to staying for another 2 nights before heading back home. We stayed in 2 different rooms and both were nice, clean and comfortable. The reception staff were lovely. On our second stay, we arrived very late at night when reception was closed, but someone who was on call came to check us in. Morehampton Townhouse is well located, as it only takes about 25 minutes to walk to St Stephen's Green. We also found very nice restaurants in the area. I highly recommend this place!",POSITIVE

Quite  close to the city center and Guiness Storehouse. The apartment was big with good standard. Even though it is close to the city it is a quiet area. Recommend this!,POSITIVE
"it was centrally located, spacious and made for a perfect break.
Doug catered for everything we asked for and went above and beyond.",POSITIVE
decor and cleanliness,POSITIVE
there was nothing I disliked about the property,NEGATIVE
Fantastic location and property was perfect. All the comforts and services of a hotel room but with the added communal space of a house allowing us as couples to relax together rather than go back to a hotel and disappear into separate rooms. Doug the owner was very helpful and allowed us to check out late due to a late return flight which was much appreciated.,POSITIVE
Door code arrival easy property clean well equipped 20 min walk to temple bar,POSITIVE
"The townhouses were nicely decorated, and well equipped with everything we could need. Doug was very communicative and made the check in process really easy. The townhouses are only a 5 minute walk from the Guinness Storehouse (well worth a visit) and a 20 minute walk from Temple Bar.",POSITIVE
"Booked 2 of the houses for a family trip for a 40th and 60th birthday for 8 of us..I arranged with Doug to put some banners up for our arrival and also for some  prosecco to be put in the fridge for us. When we arrived later than expected due to flight delays after Storm Eunice, it was lovely to see the houses with heating on and looking so inviting and balloons, banners, fresh flowers and even birthday cards and the bubbly nicely chilled. We were over the moon, cant thank Doug enough. Liberty townhouses are a real home from home. Well equipped, clean and comfortable with everything you need and just a short walk to Dublin town centre.
Doug the owner was very helpful and answered all my pre visit messages or questions promptly and nothing was too much trouble. Great service. Would hope to book again next time we visit Dublin and would recommend anyone to book here..Many thanks to Liberty Town Houses, cant think of anything negative to say. Wonderful place.",POSITIVE
Nothing negative to say. Great place to stay.,POSITIVE
"cosy, secure parking, proximity to city centre",POSITIVE

loved the cleanliness and the kindness of the staff,POSITIVE
nothing,NEGATIVE
"nothing, It’s a good quality hotel",POSITIVE
nothing,NEGATIVE
Great location.,POSITIVE
I was assigned a room on the ground floor and could hear every single footstep from the people in the room above mine. You also can't control when the heating comes on.,NEGATIVE
the room and bathroom are really nice,POSITIVE
no lift and they were having issue with hot water and the hitting . Also I could hear the music from the club beside the property,NEGATIVE
Great location close to all buzzz,POSITIVE
Would have good to have a lift inside the building. My suitcase was a bit heavy to carry it up 3rd floor.,NEGATIVE
"The room was very nice, the shower was lovely.",POSITIVE
Couldn't control heating. Was a lil bit cold,NEGATIVE
The staff were very helpful and friendly and the room was state of the art and very very comfortable,POSITIVE
There was nothing not to like,POSITIVE
it’s was very very small,NEGATIVE
"Staff were great, new & clean & a super location just minutes from St. Stephens Green and a pleasant lobby and generally a nice atmosphere,",POSITIVE
"You need to be 10years old, or a Pygmy to fit in the room. The door frame below my eye level, shower cabin was barely the width of my shoulders, 
the single bed was narrow & lopsided one spent the night hugging to the wall to prevent the mattress sliding off..
if you get a 3rd floor room you have 6 flights of stairs to climb. No lift.
No breakfast.",NEGATIVE
Great location and easy self checking,POSITIVE
"The bed is hard and uncomfortable
Very bad insulation outside, it looks like the window is wide open so a lot of noise. You can hear people talking in the street even though I was on the top floor. Let's not talk about the traffic noise and the nightclub just downstairs.",NEGATIVE
It was practically in town and close to everything and very child-friendly.,POSITIVE
very noisy building work constantly being done,NEGATIVE
Quiet clean rooms,POSITIVE
TV in sitting area of room 611 did not work,NEGATIVE
Stuff was very kind and helpfull,POSITIVE
The sink in the bathroom was a bit too small (15 cm x 20 cm) and the wardrobe was useless because missing shelfs and clothes hangers,NEGATIVE
"We loved the privacy of the apartments! Perfect size for a short stay, and convenient to downtown Dublin.",POSITIVE
"There was an issue with the outlets & wifi when we first arrived, but the cleaning staff rebooted the fuses so everything worked from the second day onward.",POSITIVE
The only reason I gave it a very good instead of exceptional is because there were two tv's & only one worked & the hot water took an ago to come through wasting so much water. I'd highly recommend this hotel its a little gem,NEGATIVE
They had been updating & I think that's why the TV wasn't working but the hot water may be more of an issue. I liked everything it was just these two issues. Never met better staff front of house or waiting staff so friendly.,NEGATIVE
"Great location, beautiful building and interiors in restaurant/bar/lounge. Most staff very helpful.",POSITIVE
"Nice, modern one bedroom flat. It was very clean. There was a kitchen and an upstairs area with a sofa.   The staff were very friendly and the breakfast bar and restaurant service was excellent. The Irish breakfast was nice and hot when it arrived.",POSITIVE
"The room was freezing all night, despite turning the radiators on.",NEGATIVE
"The location was very convenient for visiting the city, with a short walk to the tram.  Breakfast was nice, standard Irish Breakfast.  Room was spacious and had tea and coffee available.  The hotel had live music every night which was nice but was in the same room as the dinner so this might depend on personal preferences.",POSITIVE
"The Mews is out the back of the hotel in an alley way which wasn't exactly picturesque but felt secure.  Upon arrival the lock on the front door wasn't working so we had to wait an hour or so whilst they repaired it.  We were offered a coffee while we waited but it was an inconvenience.  The room was very cold and it took a couple of tries to get a portable heater from recetpion.  It seems they don't turn on the heat till later in the year, we were there in late September.",NEGATIVE
"facilities, location, customer service",POSITIVE
the seagulls dispersing the rubbish from the bins in the lane way,NEGATIVE
"The staff! They made all the difference. Forever smiling, patient and accommodating. A big shout out to the wonderful people looking after breakfast and dinner. Your service with a smile is an example to follow.",POSITIVE
The apartment view was not that great but a very minor thing. The carpet in the unit was stained or just needed more TLC.,NEGATIVE
"Extremely helpful and friendly staff, great location, room was comfortable and stylish",POSITIVE
"really great location, loved the style, the rooms with additional touches. staff couldnâ€™t have been more helpful and courteous",POSITIVE
"Towel rail in bedroom didn't work, hairdryer didn't work, wifi didn't reach room. Not worth upgrading to ""premium"" room. Very slow service at breakfast on busy days, replenishing buffet items took 30 mins+, not many choices for allergens/veggie/vegan at breakfast.",NEGATIVE
"unfortunately the noise from the clubs beside the hotel meant a sleepless night until after 2am. despite ear plugs provided on the bedside lockers, these did little to muffle the loudness.",POSITIVE
Hotel room was beautiful and bed was so comfy. The breakfast at Sophieâ€™s was incredible - best French toast Iâ€™ve tried. Being able to order drinks to the pool was a bonus.,POSITIVE
"The website failed to mention the noise issue. Hotel is attached to a night club, in a row of night clubs. Our room was directly above the smoking area meaning that until 3am every night you can hear every song, word for word, even with ear plugs in.",NEGATIVE
"loved the atmosphere and decor, thought it was really cool!",POSITIVE
"never a good sign when you see earbuds beside the bed but thatâ€™s on me, I forgot we were on the busiest nightclub street in Dublin ðŸ˜€",NEGATIVE
Everything,POSITIVE
The website said free shuttle but it was not true,NEGATIVE
Great location. Lovely decor. Loved the room. And mini bar/treats available.,POSITIVE
Water was not hot for showers in the morning and this was a big disappointment and did not reflect the price we paid.,NEGATIVE
the food was amazing,POSITIVE
Staff were amazing. The location to the town centre is great. Breakfast was included in the price and I have to say the variety of both the hot and cold was extremely good. The live music downstairs and food was good for all the family.,POSITIVE
"Super hotel, even better location! Hotel is lovely from the outside and more stunning inside. The location is just perfect to be in the centre of everything and close to parking etc. Yet we couldn't hear any noise, even on the bank holiday weekend. We will definitely be back and have told everyone about it :)",POSITIVE
"itâ€™s very central
itâ€™s has a nice vibe and the finish to the property is really nice 
the gym, health suite and bar areas were are brilliant",POSITIVE
the clubs in the area were so loud at night and went on until 3.30/4,POSITIVE
"it was absolutely incredible from start to finish, we had the best night there.",POSITIVE
"staff are very friendly, from the reception to waiting staff upstairs everyone is a pleasure to deal with. the location is brilliant and Sophieâ€™s has the best views of the city.",POSITIVE
"quite loud because itâ€™s next door to a late night bar/club, earplugs are provided which is a big help. I had a few drinks in so falling asleep wasnâ€™t an issue but this is not your location for a quiet night in.",NEGATIVE
location,POSITIVE
"shower and safe did not work, not clean, only one key",NEGATIVE
"It didn't annoy us but it might cause others difficulty, we were on the fourth floor and trying to find our room wasn't the easiest but it was fine for us.",NEGATIVE
The location is ideal for pub nightlife. The accommodation was more than adequate for 3 guests.,POSITIVE
"The bathroom works fine, but needs updating. The was limited hot water in morning.",NEGATIVE
Lonely girl looking after breakfast area,POSITIVE
"Breakfast was terrible very greasy 
Drink prices in the bar were robbery",NEGATIVE
Although the breakfast was included in our price we opted for the small cooked Irish. It was small alright! Couldn't find the bacon on the plate. The sausage was shrivelled and a little bland,NEGATIVE
Windows in bedroom didn't lock properly so felt a bit uneasy,NEGATIVE
"In the middle of Temple bar, bathroom was newly redone. Lovely people at the front desk.",POSITIVE
"Single glass windows, so it is very noisy. Even with earplugs you can still hear the music from the pubs around as if you are in the middle of the pub yourself. Room had no bathtub, booking said it should. Building is very old and could do with some renovations. It is not worth the amount of money now, but could be. For now you pay for location.",NEGATIVE
The view was lovely,POSITIVE
The bed was old and lumpy and the room was too hot and no heating on very hard to open the windows,NEGATIVE
lovely hotel in a great location,POSITIVE
The property was right on temple bar which was a very good location.,POSITIVE
Our room was very dated and old fashioned and smelt like cigarettes when we first arrived.,NEGATIVE
"If you are looking for some nightlife, this is the place to be.",POSITIVE
"Windows super old, not the best for the noisy nightlife. However that's acceptable if you want to sleep in this area.",NEGATIVE
the fact that we had to ring the bell 5 times before someone came to open up. then we were told to wait in reception door about 10 minutes before someone checked us in. the location too noisy. the tv was also not working.,NEGATIVE
"Nothing. The TV didn’t work. Walls and carpet were dirty. The only seating was extremely uncomfortable. Beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. You could hear everything outside. Downstairs door was left unlocked by the person in the other apartment on several occasions and it didn’t feel like a super safe area. On our last evening, we ran into someone coming down the stairs from our apartment, who could not have been coming from anywhere else. Shower was missing a door. Some blinds did not pull down. It was literally awful.",NEGATIVE
"Everything. My first two nights a friend was staying with me until my husband arrived. My friend left to stay in a hotel on the second night because it was so bad. I requested a refund so I could go to a hotel the last three nights but they were slow getting back to me and I wanted to see the city so I stayed, but would not recommend to anyone. Now crossing my fingers that they return my security deposit.",NEGATIVE
Was fairly close to the center. Easy to reach by bus (get a day or weekend pass),POSITIVE
"Really dirty and smelly (nicotine smell in the carpet and furniture) Mold in the kitchen and shower, flaking ceiling and dust over the complete apartment. Had to pay a €300 deposit, but when I did they were super slow to answer questions.",NEGATIVE
For the apartment nothing,NEGATIVE
Tbere was no hot water in the taps but the shower was fine,NEGATIVE
"For the service very poor i can't even cook for my family, because the stove is not good",NEGATIVE
"The location was close to the city centre. Other than that, there is nothing positive to be said about this place.",NEGATIVE
"This flat was totally filthy, a storehouse of rugged and broken furniture, dirty walls, rusty cutlery and worn-out sheets. The property is insecure, without fire protection, completely unhygienic and should be reported to the authorities. It is by far the worst place I have ever stayed at.The lock to the entrance was broken the entire week; it was ultimately fixed on the day before departure but had I not encountered the locksmith outside, who gave me a set of keys, I would have been locked out!",NEGATIVE
absolutely nothing it was a dump,NEGATIVE
it was an absolute dump probably the worst place I have ever stayed. we didn’t even want to sleep in the beds. the shower screen was missing. it stank stale and like old cigarette smoke. there was blood on the walls down the side of the bed and just filthy stains everywhere. Even the neighbours were shocked we were staying there because they asked us if we were there to repair it. the ceiling in the bathroom was about ready to fall down. However there was a good thing about it and that was the door out of it. so please if you are going to book this place wear a full face covering to stop you from getting sick.,NEGATIVE
"The hosts Hugo and Brian were utterly horrendous, they cursed at us through the phone and in person Refused to give us the keys even when we wanted to pay the deposit which may I add wasn’t mentioned or included in the fees section It was the worst service I’ve ever experienced and I don’t wish the treatment I received by these hosts to even my worst enemy.I don’t recommend you spend your money here at all !",NEGATIVE
"Everything.
Apartment in state of disrepair, damages throughout including blinds either missing or broken. Bathroom shower and toilet broken and half used mouthwash in cabinets along with medicine not belonging to us. Stains on bedroom walls and lingering bad hygiene smells (vomit). Not child friendly in any way, our children did not feel safe. 
The list goes on....
Raised with host as soon as arrived, 6 days later finally get an apology but no reconition of issues other than they consider them to be 'minor issues', they are not minor.",NEGATIVE
It had a good bus connection to the town centre The beds were quite comfortable.,POSITIVE
"The light in one bedroom did not wirk properly, it went on and off. 
There were really old used, many times fixed furniture, bins without lids e. g. in the bathroom. The hat water did not work at night, just in the morning at first, but we figured out how to change that. The shower was damaged and did not close … so the whole bathroom was under water every time somebody took a shower. Two of the towels had stains. The walls had stains, brown ones next to the toilet. The paint in the bathroom partly came off … 
I could continue for a while. I have rented apartments on booking before, but not in this condition.",NEGATIVE
"The staff where very friendly, and we could check into our rooms even though we arrived before noon. The lobby bar and the lobby was very cozy. Good location",POSITIVE
Location and size of the apartment,POSITIVE
"First of all, when we arrived, we noticed a strong odour of nicotine. Didn’t take too long to find out ashes all over the place, because the cleanliness of the apartment was very poor. The carpet was dirty and full of dust. About the heating system, 1 heater was working properly, 1 was working when it wants and 1 isn’t working at all. We tried to take a shower, but the water didn’t get an acceptable temperature. The basin in the bathroom was leaking, leaving the floor wet. The kitchen was ok, but the oven is unusable, dirty and with leftovers from other people.We tried to get assistance from the host but after the first complaint (about the smell of cigarettes), he didn't return our messages.Now we are hoping that he return our security deposit as soon as possible.",NEGATIVE
It’s in a good spot handy for town centre,POSITIVE
We had no WiFi which with the kids needed to play on iPads or phone which was disappointing because no tv there and it stated 24 hours free WiFi and think it could do with en upgrade just a little paint would help,NEGATIVE
"simple, clean room. the B&B is close to botanic garden and glasnevin cemetary. to the city centre it is only a short walk.",POSITIVE
"sometimes, you can smell the smoke from downstairs",NEGATIVE
"Place was great, clean and comfortable. Easy check in, friendly staff",POSITIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
The location is very safe and quiet. We had an American embassy appointment and this hotel was only a 9 minute walk to the embassy… it was perfect. The lady who answers the phone is extremely friendly and exceptionally helpful.,POSITIVE
"there are lots of wings,steps up and down and almost back and forth on your way to the room ! the light in the bathroom did not go off wich was then maby ok due to the smell in the toilette so we kept the door closed",POSITIVE
You get what you pay for. The room is a little cold and there is dust and mould in a few places. It is an old Victorian house. However the price is low for Dublin.,NEGATIVE
Calm neighborhood,POSITIVE
Beda and Room fine. There was no breakfast.,POSITIVE
Great location and great value for money. Rooms clean comfortable and warm,POSITIVE
"No parking, met zero staff during the stay",NEGATIVE
"location, quiet, lovely building",POSITIVE
rooms not serviced,NEGATIVE
"close to the dart, very clean and quiet, staff was very communicative over messaging.",POSITIVE
"nothing, everything was great!",POSITIVE
"Check in was easy and manager was on duty everyday
Small room, nice big bathroom, room was warm enough which was important  for our stay in January, 
loved the location we walked to Ballsbridge for dinner all 3 nights had the best Thai meal (went there 2 nights) at Baan Thai.
Walked into Dublin centre but caught uber home at the end of the day.",POSITIVE
"Staff is really friendly and helpful recently renewed, very nice food breakfast and dinner was excellent, 10 min from everything walking",POSITIVE
Decor is a bit dated but that didn't affect our stay,POSITIVE
The property felt like home.,POSITIVE
cleanliness and close to amenities.,POSITIVE
Location is excellent. Twin room was a good size. Bathroom is clean.,POSITIVE
"Shower takes a long time for the water to run (5/6 mins at least). Room was very cold, electric heater provided was not sufficient (and made noise) but admittedly it was a particularly cold night.",NEGATIVE
Very clear instructions and was a bit of an adventure. We felt satisfied that we solved the puzzle!,POSITIVE
Location was good and ease with key and check in process was very good,POSITIVE
Bit dated but was OK for what we needed furniture damaged unable to use draws in bedroom due to damaged,NEGATIVE
location,POSITIVE
No pancake for breakfast ðŸ˜œ,NEGATIVE
"key/lock front door difficult to use
no wardrobe hangers
in the bedroom which wasn’t en-suite, the doors to the outside had a gap at the top therefore letting the cold air in
very ‘modest’ didnt seem if the owner took any pride in it",NEGATIVE
The views,POSITIVE
The bed,NEGATIVE
Location suited us. a number of food options just at doorstep or short walking distance. . We even walked across the river/ by the river. Pretty quick to get to the airport as well.,POSITIVE
"not as convenient picking up key from lock box simply because of my special circumstance - i had 2 young kids with me, had a rental car and no convenient parking for loading/unloading heavy bags. So it was pretty difficult lugging bags  if you're an international traveller like us - and are weighed down with luggage. I think if the other half was present we would have managed better.",NEGATIVE
Great location. Comfortable. Very secure and safe,POSITIVE
"Needs TLC. Not much by way of extras - like coat hangers, pot towels and other basic things",NEGATIVE
"Location, spaciousness.  Overpriced for what was provided.",NEGATIVE
"The price considering what was provided.  For the price, I would have expected luxury accomodation.  A general update to the decor and fittings was definitely necessary.  At a considerably lower price the accomodation would have been acceptable, as it was, it was priced way out of my expectations.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment is very well located for the Dublin Convention Centre. There are several grocery stores nearby which makes self-catering work well. There are also more restaurants and coffee shops than I expected. Possibly the nearby college has an impact. There is a Luas station right in Mayor Square adding connectivity. It is close to Epic and to the very interesting Jeanie Johnston replica ship. There is also a stop on the Dublin Express airport bus nearby on North Wall Quay.With two bedrooms and two bathrooms, a large livingroom and a dining area, there is plenty of space. The wifi is excellent and reliable, important for conference goers or if you are working.",POSITIVE
Very comfy beds,POSITIVE
"When we first arrived the hot water wasn't working. There are no printed instructions in the apartment for the heating/hot water controls, we had to google the model of controller. After some back and forth by WhatsApp with the contact at the company, it was clear that it wasn't a matter of settings, but there was no hot water. It took several days to get this resolved. Since there seems to be only one (!) key to the apartment, we constantly had to put the key back in the lockbox to give the plumber access. Once fixed, it was good and hot.The whole operation is entirely contactless, except for WhatsApp messages and the company website/account, adding some stress to arrival. It is vital to get the 2 videos: opening the lockbox and finding and opening the gate. I had to ask for the lockbox video. It would be helpful to have more videos, such as on getting the fiddly apartment lock to open. Having only one key is also a problem when staying with others, since it is necessary to have the key to come upstairs even if one person is already home. In general the furnishings, although all serviceable, are getting worn and tired. The essentials are clean, but otherwise the property could use a deep cleaning/refresh.",NEGATIVE
There was no breakfast.,NEGATIVE
Toilet seat that is not broken; White stains around apartment; Leftover refuse from previous tenant (birthday party supplies); front door that is functional; odorous smell in toilets.,NEGATIVE
"Location was good near docks and restaurants and a tram stop. Apartment had two bathrooms, was warm and clean and located in a secure area.",POSITIVE

Minimal cutlery and glasses. Lacked oven glove, tea towel, hand towels, soap. Washing machine in kitchen but no clothes airer.",NEGATIVE

WiFi a little sketchy.,NEGATIVE
"The location was absolutely beautiful. Our hosts were amazing. The house (""cottage"") is big, well furnished, comfortable and has amazing views of the lawn and area. Just step outside to the beautiful homes and walk a short distance to the sea and the train station. Stunning in every way!",POSITIVE

"We were a bit spooked when the reception phoned our room at 01.45 saying we were making too much noise. (?). When we were speaking in a normal voice.. Not loudly, no TV, no radio etc. They claimed they had been outside our room and heard us? This was very wierd, and left the impression someone was checking to see if were in the room reported to reception next day.. But no response..",NEGATIVE

"Great location, good value for money considering how central it was. really comfortable bed too. shower was great!",POSITIVE
"only downside was the noise from inside of the hotel. could hear next door coughing or using the toilet, and people above us too. no lift either, not an issue for us but would be for anyone disabled or in a wheelchair, especially if placed on the third floor !",NEGATIVE
"Staff was helpful and the room was spacious and modern, with a large bathroom and always clean.",POSITIVE
The floors creaked and thin walls make for a louder than wanted room!,NEGATIVE
"perfectly located, included parking, very comfortable, lovely staff",POSITIVE

big property with very big windows,NEGATIVE
"We paid extra for the use of the executive lounge. However, it wax only available between 4pm-8pm so we didnâ€™t get any value from it as we had dinner reservations at 6:30. Most lounges are open all day and have a set time for alcoholic beverages in the evening. Itâ€™s a pity we couldnâ€™t pick up bottles of water and snacks throughout the day, as expected.",NEGATIVE

Great,POSITIVE
"The location is quite nice, few minutes from Q-Park The Spide, a welcoming 24h/24 open reception desk, cooking facilities were in good conditions which is quite rare in holiday rental, spacious. Our teenagers enjoyed it very much. Overall prices are crazy in Ireland and especially in Dublin, this one remains quite expensive for an hostel compared to other experiences in other countries. So next year, we'll go to Scotland or elsewhere.",POSITIVE
There were a missing curtain and an old granny that keeps her lights on all night long on the other side of the large street so...that's all...and Wifi code was not working,NEGATIVE
"Very simple, nothing extra. Exactly only what's need for a good sleep, in very nice quiet environment. No street noise, no car noise. The bed very comfortable, cause very relaxed sleep. The room temperature exactly what's need, properly warm, but setup able, so you can close it if you want. The owner very kind, helpful in everything. Kitchen has enough equipment for making breakfast or dinner if you want.",POSITIVE

The location was great for accessing the sights in Dublin. We were able to walk into the city centre easily.",POSITIVE
Leo was very kind and provides total flexibility.,POSITIVE
"Leo's place was excellent.
Clean, tidy, well stocked, comfortable
Like a big hotel room with a garden room small kitchen and outside seating 
Probably not great if you want to do much cooking but I didn't. 
Half fridge with small freezer compartment
Kettle, coffee machine, microwave and more
Utensils and cutlery, crockery, supplies like oil and spices, tea and coffee
Great ensuite shower and toilet with shaving mirror and excellent towels and bedding
Tesco Express and coupla pubs only 10 mins walk
Croke Park less than 10 mins walk
Direct bus to Temple Bar 20 minutes. Bus stop opposite the apartment

The property was lovely! Charming and great location. Two single beds are spring and not very comfortable for adult though my 5 year old slept fine,NEGATIVE
"The people above us (unsure if townhouse guests or if they live there…) had a massive row and for two straight hours all we heard was shouting, screaming, crying and stomping late in the evening.

I really liked the room in this hotel,POSITIVE
"We enjoyed our stay very much. The room was cozy and well equipped- there is everything you may need to prepare for the day of sightseeing in Dublin. Hostess is kind and friendly. There never was any trouble with communication. The neighborhood is quiet and you can quickly get to  your destination from there. There are few cafés and supermarkets nearby. City centre is easily reached by bus.
You can really experience the life in the Irish suburbia and get to know closer the culture from inside. All in all it was a lovely stay! :)",POSITIVE

"First of all the water had no pressure to have a normal shower. Also the bathroom was cold.. 
Secondly there was a lot of noise in the house. Could not go to sleep easy.. At two o clock there was a loud noise that I could not explain..
Thirdly the bed probably had bed bugs because we got bites on our legs..
Also the bed was not that clean..
Fourth the room was cold.. unfortunately we came at a cold period but that does not explain the lack of a warm room.",NEGATIVE

Incredible staff and a location that can't be best. Only pitfall was the lack of a thermostat in the room. Way too hot at night.,NEGATIVE
"Brazilian staff really helpful, the bed give you privacy and you feel in your own space. I really liked the study rooms, all the spaces are comfortable and well clean, being one of the cheap options in the city I was really surprised with the quality, could definitely have a better score.",POSITIVE
"They could make a tour in the hostel during the check in, I just found the kitchen (really good) later. They have a lot to offer.",POSITIVE
The bed bunks are little cabins that allow for privacy in the dorm rooms. The staff was super friendly and helped me switch bunk beds when the first one I got had issues,POSITIVE

A fair bit of older people- not a problem but I expected more a young hostel vibe.... Often old men in the common areas so not a vibe to hang out in.,NEGATIVE
Room was furnished to a high standard and was immaculate! Check in was super easy with clear instructions sent by direct message. The previous reviews don't do this place justice it's a lovely little spot for exploring the city. Will stay again,POSITIVE
The bathroom was separate to the room but was still private and was very well equipped,POSITIVE
"We were very well received, the location is great and the room was cosy. It was good value for money overall :)",POSITIVE
The room could be a bit cleaner and could also use a chair or extra table to be a bit more practical. A hairdryer would be a cool plus to add too.,NEGATIVE

Maybe an endtable by the bed would be nice.,NEGATIVE
"Good location, easy check in and out, private room",POSITIVE

 We had a window and our own sink.

There is limited hot water for showers.
We never saw any 'staff'.  
There are a lot of repairs needed in the house.
No breakfast or snacks provided as advertised.",NEGATIVE
"Was cleaned regularly. Cleaner air and quieter than city centre. Good location next to park. Easy walk to essential shops and bus stop. Not far to city centre by bus. Bus route to airport. Can walk to train station, canal and botanic gardens.",POSITIVE
Furnishings a little dilapidated. Would recommend a small table on landing so people can eat indoors - what do they do in winter? Move the bins from kitchen to back passage. Clear out all the leftover pantry supplies more regularly. A sign in the bathroom about what can and cant go down the toilet.,NEGATIVE
That I at least had a room to sleep in that night after my international flight was canceled.  To be fair I knew it was going to be just a place to crash so in that one way it was better than sleeping on the street.,NEGATIVE
"Nice hotel, nice bar, friendly staff, excllent location",POSITIVE
Never met one person from property.  Initial code to get into property was incorrect but luckily I called to get that figured out.  Window in room was rusted and locked in open position.  Talking from external source outside was constantly coming from somewhere. Entryway was pitch black so had to use cellphone to climb stairs to room.  Shared bathroom lights did not work and door would not lock.  At least it had a bed with linens on it.  For what I needed it for it did the job but as a place I would recommend to anybody looking for more than a hostel like stay i wouldnt recommend it.  I didnâ€™t even stay the second night I paid for and moved on to a more suitable hotel.,NEGATIVE
Location was a bit of a walk from town but that wasnâ€™t a problem,POSITIVE
"The toilet didnâ€™t flush, the shower had no curtain and was cold with no pressure. The room was dated, there was no tea making facilities in the room. It was a cheap room in comparison to others but was not fit for purpose.",NEGATIVE
It is not far from the bus stop and local shops.,NEGATIVE
"No tv or radio and the internet password didn't work, got it sorted but it didn't match the one on the sign.My room was just a bed and a desk and a wardrobe.",NEGATIVE
Amazing property so close to Dublin City Centre,POSITIVE

Gerry was very nice and allowed us to check in early. The apartment was lovely and clean and is in a wonderful location. Great vacation in Dublin!,POSITIVE
the three bedroom apartment is beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  it is central to everything and the owner is kind.,POSITIVE
"we had difficulty with the shower every day of our stay, with the water supply proving to be erratic.  on reflection, on all but one day it worked in the morning but rarely after the pub downstairs opened.  that may just be a correlation.  the owner kindly dropped everything and came to our rescue but the repeated problem was frustrating as we had two members of our group that liked to work out at the gym in the morning and shower mid day or in the evening.",NEGATIVE
"great location, good size",POSITIVE
super noisy from the traffic and pub located below the apartment. also it was so hot and difficult to sleep,NEGATIVE

"very basic accommodation, shared facilities, noise from street below from revellers returning from the Temple Bar area.",NEGATIVE
"Location was perfect, looked forward to breakfast every day although we make it ourselves the host was very friendly and always had the coffee ready every morning. I even got some free pastries from his wife who happened to swing by after work at a cafe :)",POSITIVE
Windows let in a bit too much noise from the street but luckily it’s not a busy street.,POSITIVE
The location was great and near a lot of things. The room was good and maintained well. The staff was very responsive and helpful. The connected bar downstairs was a good fall back in case the surrounding bars were too busy or crowded.,POSITIVE
Nothing!,NEGATIVE
"The owner was super nice and helpful. The shared bathrooms, although not very luxurious, where clean and had everything we needed. The location was excellent, close to bus stops and only a few minutes walk to the city centre and main highlights of Dublin.",POSITIVE
"The guesthouse has a very good price compared to other options close by. It was not very luxurious, but it suited or expectations, and as we where only there at night, it was a great fit for us.",POSITIVE
Great location.,POSITIVE
"Very noisy street, you can hear everything happening in neighborhood rooms.",NEGATIVE
"The owner or the guy who works there is very friendly and always has a smile in his face. The location of the B&B is perfect, you can walk from there everywhere. Food is there, Pubs, stores, Lidl and Tesco.",POSITIVE
"This is just a personal issue from my side, because when I need to go to the Toilette I really need to go and as the B&B has no Toilets in the rooms, and only two for the guests you can come into really bad situations.",NEGATIVE
"Location is in the city center close to all main attractions.
Friendly staff.
Although the room was basic it had a big TV.",POSITIVE
"WiFi was dodgy.
Loud guests at night.
Water in pipes is very loud when used in nearby bathrooms.",NEGATIVE

"Great location can be noisy at night, staff lovely",POSITIVE
"The upkeep was not great. It was clean- ish but the disrepair of the room sink and floor made it feel not clean. Sink was sticky with some adhesive sealant, floor had cracked spaces by sink. It was quite small. Water didn't get very warm to wash in the room. Wifi worked 50% of the time only and even then not reliable.  Upstairs bathrooms were very inconvenient to go up and down each time. Bathrooms were sparse. It was a very limited space for paying over 100 Euros per night. Also- no breakfast provided but fee was as high as bnb. They said there were places nearby to go eat!",NEGATIVE
Great check-in and helpful staff.,POSITIVE
The staff was very friendly piolet helpfull,POSITIVE

-Stairs are broken ? You feel that they are not that trustworthy walking over them but you can't see anything because of the carpet 
All in all I wouldn't stay there again. Too expensive for what you get.

"Location, friendly landlord.",POSITIVE
Location was great and friendly staff,POSITIVE
"Room and facilities well below par for €79 per night.
Stairs and banister broken, mould in shared bathroom with rest of house, ripped curtains and elic cables and plugs accross floor. Actually quite unsafe in general.
This room should not be listed on booking.com.",NEGATIVE
"Amazing little find in central Ballsbridge.  5 mins walk from the RDS where we were attending a conference and exhibition.  The cottage was delightful.  Bright, breezy, tastefully decorated, well-equipped, comfortable.  What more could we want???  Friendly host (who we didn't meet) but they had good communications.  Will definitely be back!!!",POSITIVE
"It is such a beautiful cottage, its hard to find any negatives at all but, if I had to find one it would be that I prefer cotton bedding rather than synthetic.  I still slept really well in the super comfy bed though, so no problem all in all.",POSITIVE
"Beautiful snug cottage in the middle of the City. Couldn‘t want more.
Florentina was available the whole time. Thank you!",POSITIVE

Great place to enjoy Dublin,POSITIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
"The property itself, the location",POSITIVE
"Noisy outside from very early (6am), it did mention that work was going on in the area but didn't expect it that early and on a Saturday morning",NEGATIVE

"Our family loved the Harcourt Suites!  The rooms were large and comfortable, but the best part were the small touches, like treats to go with the in-room coffee maker and comfortable shared sitting room!",POSITIVE
"Decoration was super nice, we felt at home! Also location is very central, everything is easily accessible from there.",POSITIVE
We were only provided some body cream and shower gel but not any shampoo.,NEGATIVE
"It was very homely, quite area and bed was comfortable.",POSITIVE
The location is fine and still within walking distance of major attractions. It was also a quiet location when we visited over a Saturday and Sunday. Offering afternoon tea in the parlour was a lovely touch.,POSITIVE
"Overall,  it could do with a bit of TLC and maintenance. For example, the loose front door knob, the flush lever on the toilet and the tap in the sink in the parlour. A general tidy up in the yard would be nice as well.  A heads up to guests about giving the hot water time to heat up as well - it felt like it took forever to heat up. These are all understanable in an older accommodation, but do need to be addressed. A heavier curtain in the bathroom would also be good.",NEGATIVE
Great location and room,POSITIVE
Noise from above ~ noisy neighbours late at night,POSITIVE
the location is amazing and the staff were very friendly and helpful. the rooms are very big and beautiful,POSITIVE
"Excellent location, good and helpful stuff",POSITIVE

No breakfast.  Some finger food provided.  Overripe bananas,NEGATIVE
"nice big room, comfy bed, cool building in a handy part of town. Random selection of cakes and pastries.",POSITIVE
"Confusing checkin process. Needed to read the emails carefully- one of the numbers provided they werent expecting us to ring about this property, just another one down the road. No bike parking as advertised (well, not secure anyway). But we could take our bikes upstairs and keep them in the room with us, fortunately.The landlord had offered us a partial refund as the shower head fell off onto my back, havent heard from him although he was really friendly when we were there..The room was pretty cold , with no visible option of heating it.",NEGATIVE
It was very suitable for attending the Eye and Ear Hospital. I  found the stairs a long way to climb. Refresh ments very good and welcome. Room large and  comfortable. Eating facilities and local places of interest would be useful.,POSITIVE
Stairs but l am 83years old!!!!,NEGATIVE
Great location and facilities. Ideal for our trip,POSITIVE
location,POSITIVE
The facility in the room is a bit old,NEGATIVE
"water system was noisy, no bedding for the single sofa bed.",NEGATIVE
Privacy for the family. Great location.,POSITIVE
Floor has strange sticky thing. It makes feet dirty quite often. There is bit humidity. Sofa and table needs improvement.,NEGATIVE
Not applicable,NEGATIVE
"Multiple defects in the apartment, garage was difficult to access, overall appearance of the apartment and the block was shabby and needed upgrading and a repaint.  Broken mirror in the bedroom, cracked handbasin in the bathroom, noisy cistern refill seemed to take 30 minutes after flushing the toilet. Kitchen was satisfactory.  Bedroom was OK and the bed was comfortable and warm.",NEGATIVE
"cozy place, accommodating host",POSITIVE
steep staircase,POSITIVE
loved the location,POSITIVE
apartment had a smell that did dissipate as we stayed. No hot water upon return to unit night before we left. was ok next morning.,NEGATIVE
Very comfortable beds and we were able to sleep 4 in the apartment just fine. Lots of media options on the TV and fast wifi. Washer and dryer in unit. Great location and very accommodating owner! The place was very clean as well.,POSITIVE
"Two options for breakfast (Continental and Irish). The hotel is quite big, the staff is young and friendly. There’s a luggage room available after checking out.",POSITIVE
Good breakfast! Very nice stuff! Good hotel.,POSITIVE
"Water went cold pretty quick and toilet takes a while to refill. No deal breakers at all, but a minor inconvenience for 4 people.",NEGATIVE
The apartment is exactly as shown in the listing. Check-in was easy with a lockbox right near the door.,POSITIVE
"Too much expensive because the apartament was lacking from all the point of view. No one told us how to do check in and check out. One bed was not ready, but guests had to make up it for the night.",NEGATIVE
The location was great (10 minute walk to Trinity or Temple Bar area.  And it was QUIET!  Friends of ours stayed closer to the bars and had noise all night long.  No noise here!  The host was easy to get a hold of and she came by and fixed the pullout bed when it wasn’t staying connected.,POSITIVE
"The apartment is pretty dated.  The couch covering is ripping and our daughter found it very uncomfortable (hard—she could feel the wood under the foam with her hip when lying on her side) for sleeping.  The windows open easily but because the apartment was at the same level as a 1st story roof that ran between the buildings and had maintenance shacks on it, etc, we didn’t feel comfortable leaving the windows open at night.  Someone sticky was on the floors.  The host said that it was the result of too much floor cleaner being used, but that was disconcerting.  The angle of the shower head made it hard not to spray the entire bathroom with water.  So, for the price compared to other options in the city, it was fine.  But the pictures didn’t quite match up with the experience.",NEGATIVE
"Friendly and nice staff
Got your own privacy in the room",POSITIVE
"comfortable bed, great staff, great location",POSITIVE
low water pressure in the shower,NEGATIVE
"Affordability, accessibility",POSITIVE
It's 4 floors high and no lift,NEGATIVE
Heating system works improperly in the room.,NEGATIVE
good location,POSITIVE
"Showers were super modern and lots of hot water, whole place was spotless, staff were super friendly and helpful. Couldnt have had a better experience! Would definitely recommend to any friends looking to stay in Dublin.",POSITIVE
The endless stairs.,POSITIVE
"friendly staff, the kitchen has everything you need including dishes, microwave, ovens, toasters, sandwich makers, lots of fridges and shelves",POSITIVE
the toilets and showers are quite old and the doors do not close well.,NEGATIVE
- only 4 beds in a room- comfort cozy living room,POSITIVE
I arrived after 9PM and it wasn’t possible to have a cup of tea in the hostel,POSITIVE
Absolutely loved the bunk beds. I know someone here said they were like coffins but that is just the enclosed top one and it is like that with a secure wooden side so you don't fall out as triple bunks are high. The privacy is great with black out curtains on all the bunks so you can sleep if the lights go on and you feel like you can shut yourself off if you don't want to talk to other travellers. There is a small storage box at the end of the bed as well as a light and plug socket. The mattress was super comfy and the room was warm.,POSITIVE
The weird thing was being sent a check in email which then asked for all your credit card details even though I had paid in full via booking.com. It didn't feel like a very secure site to be putting all your card details into including the CVC number and as I said I already had paid. You don't have to do this if you don't want to though and can check in when you arrive. I understand what people said about stairs as there are a lot to the third floor and I only had a small backpack. But the hostel is in a lovely street and the curtains on the bunks mean it is worth having to carry your bags.,NEGATIVE
The hostel overall is very nice and clean. The beds are really good as they are curtains for privacy.,POSITIVE
The hostel did not fix the toilet near our rooms for more than 2 days and we have to walk all the way to the next level to use the toilet which is kinda annoying.,NEGATIVE
"We weren't expecting the apartment to be as nice as it was. Past experiences with other places around the city are that the buildings are older, smaller and can be out dated, which is totally fine, but this apartment was quite large and had everything we needed. You don't have to leave the block to get most everything you need. You don't have to go very far for public transport, bars, restaurants and sites.",POSITIVE
"The price was higher, but that comes with the territory, as Dublin properties are expensive. We were on the top floor, and the window up the stairs wasn't reachable to open for air, but we were able to keep the apartment itself cool enough.",NEGATIVE
It was really close to points of interest. The beds are comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped. The easy self check in. Over all it was a nice experience as we were right in the center of Dublin.,POSITIVE
The apartment is old and needs improvements. The courtains in one bedroom barely where kept by the strings.  The bathroom is old and not so clean. We bought a cleaning spray and cleaned it just to be sure. The light in one bedroom didn't work but we used the lamp from the night stand. The radiator's display from living room was broken.,NEGATIVE
location was fine,POSITIVE
"apartment is on the top floor of a three floor building (7 flights of stairs) - No lift (elevator). Apartment whilst all facilities are functional, was a bit tired. some side lights didnâ€™t work and the main lights had many bulbs missing or failed.",NEGATIVE
"- the location of the flat close to the city centre, windows facing the back yard avoiding the noise of busy street
- quiet neighbours
- easy check-in&check-out
- daybreak store and pharmacy nextdoor",POSITIVE
"- cleanliness of the bathroom, weak pressure of  water in the shower, not sufficient light
- missing kitchen towels
- missing light bulbs in bedside lamps
- quite often homeless people sleeping in front of the entrance door or people loitering there
- open freezer in the fridge making foodstuff below it freeze
- two separate taps for hot and cold water in the basin in the bathroom",NEGATIVE
"My room was quiet and spacious, and it was ready even though I was early checking in. I have stayed before and am always happy when I can get into Leeson Bridge guesthouse. It is convenient for the places I want to go to in Dublin.",POSITIVE
"Had character to it, good size rooms and beds, kitchen had plenty of utilities and some treats to greet us, staff were very friendly and quick to help",POSITIVE
The shower ran very slowly when hot and itâ€™s very difficult to find the point at which the water stays warm rather than scorching hot or freezing cold (it is possible but only 1 out of 4 of us managed it).,NEGATIVE
"The location was great, and the size and comfort of the property. Beds are nice, easy to get keys, spacious and bright apartment. Communication was good once we checked in.",POSITIVE
"The shower is so awful, and the bathroom has just a dim light. The kitchen is missing a few essentials for a self-catering. Please add things like soap, something to clean with and a tea-towel. We bought these things, It could also do with a proper clean, there are hairs and dust all around, so the cleaning is not the best. I was also told I'd have to pay a deposit leaving me to panic and make the 350 euros available, but then they didn't even take it. Which is good just confusing, and communication about the deposit wasn't great.",NEGATIVE
Location is walkable to city centre and Dublinia. At some point this apartment would have been okay but is in dire need of repair,NEGATIVE
"The address/ directions were very unclear, the taxi had to drop us on the road, and it was very difficult to get through to anyone to ask for help. With luggage and 2 children on a busy road, next to a shelter where people were hanging around drinking and smoking this was a terrible start and it did not get much better. The apartment was filthy, I sent an email to our host regarding this, which was ignored. The chair covers were ripped, there was dust everywhere, and the toilet was broken. Andy, the manager, was very condescending, completely unhelpful. Do not stay here, the Jury's Inn across the road is a far better option.",NEGATIVE
I got an email AFTER booking that I needed to pay a security deposit of â‚¬260 to obtain the address/details to get into the apartment. Scam. Scam. Scam. Scam. Please do not book here. We were left stranded in Dublin late at night.,NEGATIVE
Close to town centre ðŸ‘Œ,POSITIVE
Climbing all the flights of stairs to the apartment.,POSITIVE
"Nothing. It's a horrendous apartment, very dirty and run down.",NEGATIVE
nothing,NEGATIVE
"The apartment is very dirty and run down:- stains on the pillows, on the curtains- the coffee table is overly used and damaged- no lightbulbs in the lamps (and the lamps have an EU plug but no adapter)- the bathroom sink is the most inane thing ever - two separate taps for hot and cold water- the freezer door is missing- barely any light in the bathroom- the shower is barely functional (either hot or cold, no inbetween)- lots of dust and grime everywhere- we complained about the cleanliness and, indeed, they contacted us after a few days (but we were out an about and were not able to answer) to send someone to fix the shower- in the final day they did manage to get in contact with us (to inform us that there will be someone sent over to change the matresses)- in that final day they also informed us they will refund one full day for the trouble we've had with cleanliness, however now they're saying they'll be refunding us only 100 euros (why go back on your word?)Basically, stay away - this is a huge scam.",NEGATIVE
"Great location. Could walk to city centre.Very, very clean. Friendly owners and really appreciated that Paddy let me leave my luggage for the day. I thought the price was amazing and appreciated having my own bathroom. I stayed in the mini double room and while small it was more than adequate for a person travelling alone. Bed was very comfy. Lots of towels and I liked that I could open the window and view the street outside",POSITIVE
Everything was great!,POSITIVE
Quiet and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size.  Close to the train station and lots of connections to the city.,POSITIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
"I like the design of the bedroom and the comfort. 
I liked the carpet and table provided.",POSITIVE

I also didn't like I had to leave the room to enter the bathroom.",NEGATIVE
Very good stuff and place. Comfortable apartment.,POSITIVE
We didn't had something for cleaning dishes. And also some plastic bags in the room/kitchen for garbage from product,NEGATIVE
Great place and people,POSITIVE
"Location was ok, a little walk from centre. Light breakfast was adequate.",NEGATIVE
"Shower was broken. Didn't sit on the hook. Had to hold it while trying to shower.
No hot hot water for 17:00 shower.",NEGATIVE

cosy 
tram line to the city centre right there",POSITIVE

carpets maybe need some updating",NEGATIVE
great location and friendly staff. clean and comfortable,POSITIVE
like everywhere in Ireland right now overpriced. No breakfast,NEGATIVE
"This is the best value for money in Dublin we could find. Incomparably cheaper than the rest of the properties. Yet the hotel is still in the central location, all facilities existed (so nothing was ""missing"" as such, it was clean, and the staff was so kind. Warmly recommended!",POSITIVE
everything was ok for that price.,POSITIVE
"Mark is very friendly, helpful. The location is great. Room 8 has private bathroom and mini kitchenette.",POSITIVE

"Great location, just a few minutes walk to St. Stephens Green and from the the majority of museums and attractions.Cozy room with wall to wall carpet, sauna(!) and free breakfast included. Breakfast was plain but a welcome surprise.",POSITIVE
"When I arrived evening/night time, the room I booked had no curtains. I booked last minute and I saw online earlier in the day that another room was also free. I asked to changed room to a room that had curtains but I was told there was no spare room. I saw the room next to me ajar all night, it was an empty room, bigger then mine BUT it did have curtains. I felt it was terrible to put somebody in a room they paid for at the front of a house with just a net curtain. It wasn't acknowledged and they didn't care at all. I was told they were being washed and would be back in a few days.",NEGATIVE
Small house but snugy! For me was important location. And location was good. For short term trip it's Ok but for long term - No.,NEGATIVE
Smell of paint was not pleasant and annoying.,NEGATIVE
Unclean.,NEGATIVE
"having stayed here previously, I knew location was ideal for me",POSITIVE
the room was quite cold and there no curtains on the window,NEGATIVE
Great location. Lots of space for parking. Cosy room.,POSITIVE
"There were no proper curtains on the window, just a sheet of lace. The window overlooked a busy road, meaning that if the lights were on, anyone could look up from the street and see right into the room. There was also visible damage to the front door. When it came time to check out, there was no one available and no instructions about leaving a key.",NEGATIVE
"This property is an old type house, with 1 bathroom serving 5 rooms a possible  10 + people  very meager .  The rooms are adequate cups etc could do with a clean, very little in coffee/ tea   but worse still no access to clean water in the modern era  no mains water??  I would recommend this place on a very low budget scale Expect little and got little,",NEGATIVE
The staff was really polite and helpful. The room had sauna and jacuzzi. The area was very quiet. Even if there’s some traffic on the road just outside the hotel you don’t hear a lot of noise. The aircoach bus stop just outside the door,POSITIVE
The bed was very comfortable,POSITIVE
"The carpets were dirty, there was no mirror in the room, on top of the wardrobe there were clothes, dirty towels in the drawer, tea & coffee area was dirty",NEGATIVE
"Bed was good, room was tiny. Staff was very friendly if not a bit distracted.",POSITIVE
Shared bathroom. Not a problem but there was virtually no water pressure making both showering and flushing the toilet virtually impossible. Very noisy too. Hoovering was done in the other rooms until 9pm.,NEGATIVE
Close to the Luas and price was good! Staff were friendly,POSITIVE
We had to pay cash which was disclosed only when we arrived and it took a while to get checked in.,NEGATIVE
"The property was excellently located, just a block from the Sandymount DART station.  Despite the weather being rainy and cold, we stayed warm inside.  The beds were very comfy and soft, and the television channels offered a good diversity of programs.",POSITIVE
"The nearest grocery is approximately 750m away from the property.  The kitchen had enough tea for us, but no coffee and no sugar or sweetener.",NEGATIVE
"The room is just in front of the reception so you hear people getting in and the door opening. It takes  25/30 min walking to get to temple bar. It was nice to get some free breakfast but there was some yoghurt just the first day. Then we had only bread, jam and coffee. Better than nothing anyway",NEGATIVE

This was the perfect location for our last night in Dublin. It was very close to the airport and they include shuttle services to the airport. The apartment we got was on the 15th floor and there was a balcony with a great view of Dublin. The rooms themselves were a bit small but there was a living room and kitchen that was very spacious. I would definitely stay here again.,POSITIVE
the boiler water system: was noisy,NEGATIVE
"For a 4 star hotel the bathroom cosmetics, for a couple, are not enough. We only had 2 soaps, 1 body wash and 1 shampoo. There was no shower cap and for a 4 star hotel we expected to have a body lotion. The breakfast was nice but in our last day, at 9:30 (with still 1 hour to finish breakfast time) we didn’t have any fresh bread left despite the waitress told us that the bread was in the oven. So we’re lied and we’re not pleased with this attitude.",NEGATIVE
it was great and so clean and comfortable.,POSITIVE
Good location close to airport.,POSITIVE
Many heavy doors in apartment that were noisy and would lock unexpectedly.,NEGATIVE
Supper and breakfast were both good,POSITIVE
the cleanliness and comfort,POSITIVE
outside property needs to be tidied a little more.,NEGATIVE
"The apartment was spacious and clean.  The cooking facilities in the kitchen were more than sufficient to cook the food we bought at the Lidl store just down the street.  The beds were comfortable, and the bathroom worked well.  The room includes a long, enclosed balcony from which the view is fantastic (we were on one of the upper floors).",POSITIVE
"For some reason the bathroom was hot when we arrived.  The heat was not on, yet it must have been 90 degrees in the bathroom and surrounding area.  The hotel staff brought us a large fan, which we used to cool the bathroom down (we opened all the sliding glass doors in the apartment to let the cool outside air come in).  The other problem was the combination washing machine-dryer; there were no instructions and no manual, and the controls used hieroglyphic-style symbols, which meant nothing to us.",NEGATIVE
The rooms were very hot for some reason,NEGATIVE
"Overall the apartment was wonderful, but there are a few things lacking or needing improvement:Lack of instructions for things such as thermostats, washer/dryer, balcony lights, no dishwasher nor laundry detergent provided, no standard items such as body wash, shampoo.  Incredibly warm, so required three fans to keep bedrooms comfortable for sleeping.  Incredibly small shower in second bedroom and we're not oversized people.  Lastly living room furniture sleek looking, but incredibly uncomfortable - design error!  Could use another chair in that room as well.",NEGATIVE
The view was amazing,POSITIVE
I could have had helP to carry things up to the 14th floor. No trolly to use to assist,NEGATIVE
The place was clean and warm the staff were super friendly,POSITIVE
Lots of noise outside,NEGATIVE
"Very clean (bedroom, bathroom, kitchen), free food for breakfast, very nice people and staff ! Close to everything, 10-15 min walk to get to the centre",POSITIVE
"The Garden Backpackers hostel was excellent. It is very small and quiet, and has just about everything you could want in a hostel. The vibe is very relaxed and chilled, it's in a residential neighbourhood but very close to the centre of Dublin.",POSITIVE
"Honestly, nothing. The only thing I would say was there was only 1 bathroom for each of the sexes on our floor, and 1 disabled toilet so 3 in total. The toilets were also in the same room as the shower, so if someone was having a shower you couldn't use the toilet. This didn't cause a problem for me but I can imagine it might in some cases.",NEGATIVE

It was a comfortable hostel. I slept well. Staff were friendly.,POSITIVE
Breakfast too basic for Room price,NEGATIVE
"All accomodation in Dublin is very expensive, so this hostel is cheap by Dublin standards, but expensive by all other standards.",POSITIVE
"The owner, Terry, is extremely friendly and helpful, made the stay great. Peter was also wonderful at check-in, giving a map of the area, tourist reccomendations,  bus routes, and even offering coffee or tea! Overall a wonderful little spot in a nice quiet neighborhood, slightly out of the way from the city center but not so far that you couldn't bus or taxi in a reasonable amount of time. Extremely impressive for the price, especially on a weekend in tourist season. I'd definitely stay here again if I ever get the chance!",POSITIVE
"Very friendly family team.  Helpful with directions, transport and information. Very comfortable warm room. Good location for Leopardstown Racecourse and coach from Airport.",POSITIVE
Nothing! Minor suggestion would be a thicker or larger towel in the shower room and maybe a fan heater or heated rail.,NEGATIVE

I think access to a communal microwave would be helpful.,NEGATIVE
The hosts were very pleasant and extremely helpful,POSITIVE
"There are very few facilities--restaurants, shops,etc. --nearby, and it is farther from the airport than we had expected.",NEGATIVE
"The bedroom, kitchen and bathroom were very clean and served our purpose to have 4 adults sleep before leaving from Dublin Airport. Owner runs a taxi service to the airport.",POSITIVE
Place is small. We had to.move table and chairs to move out the pull-out couch.,NEGATIVE
"It looks exactly how it does in the pictures. Modern, self contained, we could come and go as we pleased. On site parking, actually quite a good location for the city centre.",POSITIVE
There was no hot water for the shower (but we didn’t address this with the owner so could have been something we did wrong),NEGATIVE
Had everything you could possibly need. so clean and modern and a great use of space. host was very accommodating. best value for money Ive seen in a long time.,POSITIVE

The staff was incredible and helpful. They assisted us with our bags and gave us advice on bus fares an helped us get around the city. The house doesn't have any parking but he let us know which areas were available for free parking and helped us to navigate over to those streets successfully.,POSITIVE
"The house is on the corner so we could hear the cross walk beeping all night and it was a little rough while we were trying to sleep -- this is no fault of their own and I don't hold it against them in any way, but maybe bring a pair of earplugs to get a restful night sleep.",POSITIVE
It was ok,NEGATIVE

We loved it - amazing room - much bigger than expected with a sauna too! It was like an Aladdin's cave! Thank you so much. We had the best time.,POSITIVE

Look forward to our next visit.",POSITIVE

There is a kitchen stove and a washing machine  though we didn’t do any laundry as  buying a full box of  laundry detergent would add to our luggage weight. There is also a sofa bed although it wasn’t easy to tuck it back in the morning.,POSITIVE
location,POSITIVE
"The location in Corn Exchangec is quite far from Heuston rail station and it was difficult to get a taxi at 8am to go to the station. We booked with Lynk.com  taxi the night before but it never came and after some anxious 20mins on the main street to hail one, we felt so lucky to get one. We also felt the cleanness could still be improved.",NEGATIVE

Avoid Peploe's. Train service just around corner of apartment. Visit Howth which is 30 minutes train ride to stroll along cliffs, beautiful experience.",POSITIVE
"Suggest pertinent check-in information to be given ahead of time. I had to call the host from airport and was initially advised to call her back again when we are at apartment. This I found inconvenient as I was already talking to her plus I was concerned that my  international  phone connection might get spotty. She did agree to send me  check-in info then. Host was friendly and responsive; however, guest should not be the one initiating contact.Should have at least 2 set of keys which we have previously requested but told we can keep key in lock box; however I did not find this secure as box is shared with other apartments. Apartment can be cleaner, some dust and cobwebs in bedroom.",NEGATIVE

The house was warm and clean. Great layout. Plenty of room for sleeping and living. Location suited us very well.,POSITIVE
The check-in was very complicated and designed for overseas guests. I understand the need for making sure the tenants are trustworthy but there must be an easier way.,NEGATIVE

All cleean and Wondetfull,POSITIVE
The location was ok,NEGATIVE

I will not recommend that property for anyone.",NEGATIVE
The bedding was clean.,POSITIVE
"The whole property was in a bad state generally. The facilities were poor to meet the needs of our small family. Broken items were left in communal lounges. Bathrooms were not usable due to lack of water coming through either to hot, tap not working or plug to use bath.The photos on website do not reflect the property as some are not even there. It breaches health & safety standards. I will be writing a complaint letter and asking for a refund. Listing all my concerns.

"1. The email instructions I received for entering the property specified the key would be in a locked box. This was not so. The key was under a flower pot. I was not given prior notice about this change. I had to send the host a message and patiently wait for a response. I attempted to call twice and there was no response.  The lock appeared to have been broken in-to. 2. Within a short period of time of entering the property, a real estate agent knocked on the door and pressured us into allowing her to enter for her prospective buyers to view the property. I was not informed the property was for sale or that there would be any viewings during my stay, prior to my arrival. The booking had been arranged at least a week ago. The estate agent claimed not to have been informed about our stay either.3. Prior to arrival, an iron was requested by email. On arrival there was no iron. A subsequent message was sent requesting an iron. I was advised one would be provided. No iron was provided for the duration of the stay and I was forced to purchase one from a shop.4. On the last day, one of the kitchen table chairs broke when my elderly father sat on it, hurting his back.5. The top floor shower did not work. A member of the host's team came to fix and by the evening it stopped working and did not work for the remainder of the stay.6. The middle floor shower was unstable and fell on two family members during use.The only working shower is clearly broken and precariously balanced, falling over from the pressure in the pipe.7. The boiler was not working properly and as such, the shower water was cold. Each family member was forced to have a cold shower. A member of the host's team came to fix and by the evening, it had stopped working properly.8. Only some of the blinds worked.9. There we an abundance of items left by previous tenants in cupboards.",NEGATIVE
Very clean; air conditioning / heating was easy to understand and quick to adjust.,POSITIVE
no heat or hot water in the property,NEGATIVE
Location was fantastic. Home away from home with hosts who were very welcoming and accommodating,POSITIVE
The living room and kitchen were wonderful!,POSITIVE
"The bathroom was a bit dated, and the double bed could use a mattress topper or a new mattress altogether.",NEGATIVE
"Location is good, walk to the city or the coast. Apartment was clean. 
Dublin is worth a visit, maybe in other accommodation?",POSITIVE
"Creditcard was declined on booking.com. Apparently standard procedure. €500 damage deposit? Had to pay direct to rental company with the same creditcard. 
Received no email with entry details, and had to ring the rental company minutes before arriving at apartment. 
We found the keys with escape room type instructions. 
For this price is there no excuse for the matras on the main bed, is very old and hard with springs sticking in your side. 
The stove top looked normal but was impossible to control and very hard to use! 
The bathroom/shower was clean but very old and taps impossible and a power pump for acceptable pressure. Ran out of water once after two short showers!! pffffff",NEGATIVE
Close to beaches. Nice area.    All facilities available>   Would have preferred a dishwasher for a short stay.,POSITIVE
mpossible to open windows/door to balcony as keys not available.   Hard time to get the keys through Guestready.   Showering was an issue as no real explanation on to get hot water was available,NEGATIVE

The location is great and the room comparing to the price is comfortable!,POSITIVE
Actually nothing,NEGATIVE
"It is not possible to communicate with the staff because there is no reception, only a private room, even if you knock on the door they don't answer, I should have asked for my room to be cleaned, if I hadn't asked it didn't happen and towels too, for such a price you expect a breakfast that doesn't exist",NEGATIVE
Solo room is big for one person (small double bed)Location close to bus stops to city Checkout was easy Private toilet,NEGATIVE
"Bed was not made during my entire stayRoom heating not sufficient, was a bit coldOpen skylight window in toilet for ventilation, allowing cold air to come inHot water controls in shower are finicky, water too hot Only one plug point in the room , which was behind the bed, had to move the bed to use itCheck in process not smooth Sink is small, impossible to fill the kettle from sink, have to use own water, which makes no sense",NEGATIVE
accessible and reasonable,POSITIVE
"Location. It was close to few good restaurants.( example - The Ivy house)
Easy to find and not too far from aeroport.
A lot of shops, supermarkets, restaurants, take away food, around the area.",POSITIVE

Thin walls (you could hear everything from the rooms next door)
Lack of connection/outlets for Europeans",NEGATIVE
Everything fine; you get what you pay for.,POSITIVE
Location is good as the bus stop to and from the airport is right outside the property.  Downtown is a short walk away.  I was given a room with a big nice backyard.  Room is clean.,POSITIVE
"The only problem, but a very big one, is the very poor quality of wi fi.  I stayed there for four nights.  The wi fi was very poor throughout this period, with numerous disruptions. I eventually gave up. This is unacceptable for a well developed country like Ireland and also one of the most expensive countries in Europe.",NEGATIVE
check in. cleanliness.,POSITIVE
roadside is pretty loud and took a night to get used to.,NEGATIVE
"Excellent location - between the airport and city centre. On main bus route and O' Connell Street is walkable (30-40 mins). Supermarkets and eating places nearby, very convenient. Wasn't sure how to get in at first, but then realised a message was sent via booking.com (instead of email) - apart from this, I actually liked the fact that you just get in using the door code provided and room key already left on the door and no need to interact with anybody, but may be that doesn't appeal to everybody.",POSITIVE
"The room I stayed in (no.1) faces the main road and with only single glazed window. For those of you who can't sleep with road noise, you will need ear plugs (it's a main road to the airport). Shower was a bit dodgy - shower head not great, temperature hard to control and bi-folding door somewhat broken, but it served the purpose.",NEGATIVE
"The apartment was beautiful, really well laid out and in a lovely area. Could not have asked for a better apartment and everything was so smooth. The owner contacted me with all information prior to the stay and went through everything in detail and contacted again after check in to ensure we got there ok and got in ok.",POSITIVE
"Nothing, everything was great. Just the cleaners came before check out time and we were in the middle of cooking a fry so didn't get to enjoy our breakfast/",NEGATIVE
Great wee hotel.....Spotless !!,POSITIVE
Richard was a lovely host. Location was very handy and close to kilmainham gaol.,POSITIVE
"The host was fantastic and very responsive to all of our questions! He would answer very quick, and even sent us a short video to explain how to get to the apartment. He was very transparent that there was a small bathroom issue that no one was able to come fix because we were staying during the weekend, but it was no big deal at all, and we appreciated the honesty. Apartment itself was very nice also. Bus stop was not too far away so it was easy to get places. Recommend for friends traveling together or even a family.",POSITIVE

Our room was indulgently comfortable - king size bed, a battalion of cozy cushions, and very tastefully decorated. Plus, the bus into Dublin city center was only three minutes walk away from their front door!",POSITIVE

wow what a amazing property no expense spared on this amazing shower most comfortable bed. fresh fruit in room tea coffee and whisky you could not wish for anything else.,POSITIVE
the hosts were the most amazing people you could ever meet kind freindly and very helpful.,POSITIVE
Breakfast was every day more than enough and always varied. Dairy products and fruit was provided for us in the refrigerator. The hosts were courteous and friendly. The size of the room (room no. 2) was perfectly adequate for two people and clean. Stores and bus stations were in the immediate vicinity. With several lines you are in the city center in 15min. At this house you can have the real dublin experience because this is a private room and not a hotel. :),POSITIVE
The window above the bedroom door lets in light. I woke up when people in the room beside me turned on hall light and bathroom light which was a pity.,NEGATIVE
it is confortable and the owner are kind and try to help,POSITIVE
No breakfast here but lots of kind offers to have coffee etc.The hosts were incredibly helpful and kind.,POSITIVE

"My family stayed in this room. The location was amazing and great faculties nearby. It is a great location for cafes, restaurants and bars at a walking distance. The staff were extremely helpful and answered any questions we had. Even told us about fun attractions for the Kids. Really enjoyed our stay and a big thanks to all the staff going above and beyond for our stay. Thanks !",POSITIVE
Great big room very basic but perfect for my big group of friends travelling to Dublin. The location could not have been better made the trip so care free having everything at your door step. Would recommend to any group staying in Dublin.,POSITIVE
The Tara suite was amazing. Great view of Dublin over the liffey. Super comfortable and great space for big groups! My family and I had a lovely stay and the staff made sure to go above and beyond to ensure that we were happy. Could not recommend this accommodation more. Great for family's and groups. Look forward to returning.,POSITIVE
The hallway out of it is quite literally the only think I liked. In all seriousness you’d be better off on the streets in regards to cleanliness and cold. Shower and toilet facilities should be bulldozed also.,NEGATIVE
"Everything about this place was horrible. If it hadn’t of been for the guy who was on the phone, also the same person who showed us to our room, we would have made a U-Turn inside 2 seconds of being in there. We didn’t want to seem rude after having such a good staffing experience.",NEGATIVE
"Awsome location next to river, bus stops and down town area. Room worked great for family! Great value!",POSITIVE
"Hard to find, listing didnt make it clear rooms more of air bnb style, didn't know that contacting staff ahead of time was essential. Please warn of number of steps ahead of time. Got check in instructions only 2 hours before late check in prices kicked in.",NEGATIVE

Everything was brilliant.,POSITIVE
"We had such a wonderful stay at Blackrock B&B . Our expectations were exceeded and everything was perfect. The room is comfortable and the decor is beautiful, the breakfasts just fantastic, it’s very near the station and an easy train ride into Dublin or out to Dalkey. Highly recommend.",POSITIVE
Lovely Hostess..very kind and generous. Made hot tasty scrambled eggs toast and fresh fruit and coffee..everything I love for breakfast.,POSITIVE
I forgot to ask if option for gluten free toast for my husband… but he was happy with muesli and coffee anyway…and didnt ask for this with his scrambled eggs. Im sure if I had asked on booking this would have been provided by our excellent hostess. I will next time.,POSITIVE
"AS it was Christmas the house was decorated throughout. The room was warm and comfortable. The hosts were lovely, giving us some good advice on where to eat and how to get there. The breakfast was scrumptious and nothing was too much trouble from an extra slice of toast to another pot of tea. Would we stay again...YES!!!",POSITIVE
"from the very moment of door opening and entrance hall it felt special, the quality and finish and decor of every area was exceptional and felt more like boutique hotel than a B&B, even saying that does not do it justice, this is better than most hotels.",POSITIVE

Close to amenities. Warm. Spacious.,POSITIVE
"My allotted parking space was taken by someone else so I parked in another spot but was afraid of clamping. Also you need a printer to get the parking disk and itâ€™s dated 2019. Would be handy if in the same spot as the keys. Sound proofing not great, could hear people outside but a quiet estate thankfully",NEGATIVE

"Parking permit promised, didnt receive one despite phoning 4 times and being promised one.
Parking is excellent simple and within 50m but the worry of getting clamped wasnt nice.
It didnt materialise afterwards.
Shower hose broken and blocked and shower impossible to regulate.
Despite the issues I raised it is a spotlessly clean, luxurious apartment.",NEGATIVE
Easy parking despite not receiving a permit for the spot.,POSITIVE
Location was great. Amenities were close by. Rooms were reasonably spacious. Garden space good for relaxing.,POSITIVE

"Very good accommodation, breakfast and location",POSITIVE
"The lack of communication at the time of booking. They could inform to present the physical card before constraining people. I was very upset that they didn't inform me. I had to pay again with another card and they refunded me, I understand that all this is for security, but they should inform this detail at the time of booking confirmation.",NEGATIVE

breakfast is a bit of a joke. carpets seriously stained. heating broke in winter for a day. they close the common room and kick everyone out at 11pm. bed was bent. really should be cheaper for what you’re getting.,NEGATIVE
Great location(close to pubs and attractions),POSITIVE
"Bed,shower,canteen.",POSITIVE
Very nice and comfortable appartement. Well located (15min by walk to downtown). The renter is very helpful and is always trying to fund solutions which suits to you. Much appreciable,POSITIVE
Only one main key for an appartment of 10 person is not really sufficient.,NEGATIVE
amazing house with lovely bedrooms and great communal areas easy walk into the city centre,POSITIVE
"Great stay at this house. It was modern, well equipped and warm, with underfloor heating in the games/drinks room in the basement. Although the bathrooms were shared, they had good shower units and facilities. Bedrooms were generous with double beds and everything was clean and tidy. Only drawback for us was there was only one key for the front door. Could have done with a Yale key as well as front door key and two sets of each. Other than that the communication with the owners was excellent and the location not too far from the centre; about 30 mins to Temple Bar by foot and 10 mins by Uber. There was even a garden that in less wintery weather would just have added to this really smart accommodation. Highly recommended and good value for a group of up to 10 sharing 5 rooms.",POSITIVE
Market Bar overcharged us for a meal which wasn't great although the food was v. good.,NEGATIVE
Location is the best,POSITIVE
beautiful y renovated property but be aware all beds ( 5 only) are double beds and the sofa bed is actually a recliner,POSITIVE
Booking.com had incorrect information about bed numbers when I booked. There are two kitchens but o ly one half sized dishwasher,NEGATIVE

parking was a bit problematic.,NEGATIVE
Breakfast was crap dry scrambled egg and somehow cold fried egg and they were straight from kitchen no idea how you can create a cold fried eggRooms are so bloody dark you cannot see - and I mean when all the lights are on they are still dark.,NEGATIVE

"Pretty far from central Dublin, but you can easily take bus 40D and it will take you about 50 minutes and cost 2.50 euro. alternatively a taxi is about 30 minutes and costs 30 euro one way. 
The neighborhood is quaint and quiet, but not much going on there at all.",NEGATIVE

"The bed was truly comfortable and I loved the fact that there was a small kitchenette with spices, coffee etc.",POSITIVE
"It was a bit difficult to get to the centre until i got used to which buses I had to catch and on which bus stops I had to stop. The bus 40D on Sundays takes a bit longer to come, every 50 minutes i think (in the afternoon) but other than that it was great.",POSITIVE
Everything.,POSITIVE
It's a very nice place with nice and lovely team. Very clean. Was very happy wth everything,POSITIVE
How clean was the room and all the house and the kindness of the owners. Anytime I saw them they were offering a charming smile and attentions for the room.,POSITIVE

"Great location, excellent condition.  Cool TV",POSITIVE
"It was cold in the bathroom, I did not figure out how to turn on the heating there, in the bedroom everything was fine with the temperature.  Also, the rug is not very clean and there was something on the head of the bed, some kind of dirt.  There are also other people's socks under the bed and I found a PS4 gamepad there (I left it on the table).  Perhaps a previous visitor forgot it.  Everything else was great. no hair dryer",NEGATIVE
"Location, space",POSITIVE
"Late night outside noise, cold water",NEGATIVE
Great breakfast,POSITIVE
There was a hiccup with the check in where our room was not ready but the host was quick to respond and provided an alternative room. Even for the new room the keys was not available but the host was quick to provide an alternative and provided a spare key.,NEGATIVE
Location,POSITIVE
Very basic considering the cost,NEGATIVE
Right in the heart of Templebar which is noisy but great fun. Excellent for night birds and for feeling the buzz. We enjoyed the roof terrace. The hosts were accessible via what's app and checked we were ok and resolved the bedding issue very quickly,POSITIVE
"The office couldn't find the keys - it's quite a walk from the office to the apartment. There was no tea towel or mat to stand on outside the shower. The photo of it's location on the website wasn't where the apartment was.      The apartment was clean enough,mirrors had cracks in and dining chairs were marked. It could do with a deepclean.",NEGATIVE
"Great location- you're next door to the bars/ pubs and sightseeing attractions are within walking distance. Apartment was a good size, comfy beds, nice balcony to look over. Host was helpful to sort out an issue with the deposit after the trip. Would definitely stay again.",POSITIVE
One of the bathrooms wasn't cleaned properly. One of the shower heads kept falling from its holder. Would have been nice to have more than one key.,NEGATIVE
Apartment was clean and comfortable close to bars and restaurants,POSITIVE
We didnt get the key until 16.20 after many many phone calls which caused us major issues due to us scheduled to pick up match tickets. Very loud music up to 4am and cleaning on the streets started at 5.30am so dont expect much sleep.. it is perfect for a Hen or stag night as location good for all bars and restaurants but thats it.. no shower gel or shampoo supplied and no bottles of water supplied,NEGATIVE
"No personal contact, keys just locked to bicycle post somewhere on the street...",NEGATIVE
"great service as always, I had requested flowers which were beautifully arranged too",POSITIVE
"The host was so helpful. Sending videos of check in. Sent bus schedules to help from landing at the airport.
The host checks in with you.
Central location to everything 
Nice apartment",POSITIVE
Not much.,NEGATIVE
"The unit feels like your borrowing someone's home at a fairly high rental rate.  Too many personal items, poorly equipped kitchen.  The real issue is the poor maintenance.  the unit is unsafe as a rental.  we were locked in a bedroom as the door handle didn't function from the inside.  this unit should not be in a rental pool and I'm disappointed that booking had it on their site",NEGATIVE
"The number on the door was not displayed, so made it very difficult to find on night of arrival",NEGATIVE

Excellent stay. Great location. Highly recommended.,POSITIVE
All was 100%,POSITIVE
"The room is tidy, the bathroom attached is clean. Daniel, our host, was very friendly and welcoming. The location is not that far from the airport (just ten minutes by taxi), so it was perfect for us because our flight arrived quite late. The neighbourhood is very green and peaceful. From the bigger roads nearby (around ten minutes walking), there are direct bus connections to Dublin's inner city (e.g. O'Connell Street).",POSITIVE
The neighborhood is quiet and the view from the room covers a green front yard and a nearby park. The young couple running the place are very helpful if you need to find your way around Dublin.,POSITIVE
"Location is close to the airport with a frequent bus connection that takes just 10 minutes but keep in mind you'll have to walk further 10-15 min. to reach the property (you can walk along the road but if you don't have wheeled luggage I recommend walking through the park, it's very nicely kept).",POSITIVE
"The host super friendly, the place clean and with very high standards, the location well connected to the airport as well as to the city",POSITIVE
Everything,POSITIVE
"Tracey was a great hostess... very kind and friendly. The room was both clean and comfortable. The bed was especially amazing and even better after a long days walk around the city. It is remote and the nearest bus stop is about a 2km walk up the road that can connect you to the city center, but bus schedules can be hit and miss, so be prepared to get a cab as backup. There are a few restaurants just passed the bus stop, not more than a 1hr walk at the most. You can hit the nearest restaurant/pub in about 20 minutes on foot, or you can have food delivered. All in all, it was a great stay. I would definitely stay here again.",POSITIVE
Breakfast was not included,NEGATIVE
"It was an old home , a little damp , and the shower was brutal .  It needs a lot of work !",NEGATIVE
The ambience and decor.,POSITIVE
No private bathroom.,NEGATIVE
The property was beautiful and the owner was very nice and helpful.,POSITIVE
It was in the middle is no where.  It is fine if you have a car without a car you can’t get anywhere to get food.  It would be nice for the owner to have breakfast since it is not close to food.  They might have bikes but I didn’t ask.  Other than that it was fine.  Beautiful old property but keep in mind you are very far from Dublin.,NEGATIVE
"Lovely hosts! Felt welcome and although the home/castle is occupied by owners & other guest rooms upstairs..we had lots of autonomy & privacy.location outside of Dublin (southern side so access to eastern shore exploring was good for uskitchen is kitted well with condiments, etcback garden accessed through kitchen is a nice spotclose-ish to Jonny Fox's pubeasy parking",POSITIVE
"It's a shared kitchen, which the photos on the listings may lead one to believe that it's joined to one's room..it's adjacent..just 5 steps down the hall.",POSITIVE
Keys were easily handed over. The bedrooms looked nice and the beds were comfy.,POSITIVE
"To get there we had to walk 20 minutes on food on the roadside from the nearest bus or tram station. Definitely recommended to arrive by car of you can.  We never met our hosts, except for 2 minutes when the keys were handed over.No stores nearby.",NEGATIVE
"Great location  room spotless, staff lovely, breakfast delicious great place to stay",POSITIVE
"Spacious double room with ensuite bathroom. We had access to a well equipped kitchen and dining area that is not directly linked to the bedroom but is just 5 footsteps across the hall. We also had sole use of a lovely back garden.  My impression is that this Kitchen and garden may not necessarily be available with this ""double bedroom"" booking depending on whether other people have booked the bedroom that is directly linked to the kitchen and garden on this first floor. Luckily for us that linked room was not booked so we had everything we expected/hoped. So I would suggest enquiring about these aspects if kitchen use is key to your requirements. Nonetheless there was a fridge/freezer and kettle in the bedroom itself.
One thing that threw our stay was that I thought, from the pictures, that there was a separate living/dining room/kitchen where the sofa bed was located but discovered that the sofa bed and double bed are in the same room which was a bit of a disaster for me as I was travelling with Mother who snores loudly!!! This was entirely my own fault for making assumptions.
Johnny the host and his wife were lively hosts. Johnny was very accommodating with offers of a lift twice to Shankill as my elderly mother and I don't drive. There was a very laid back atmosphere in this family home come hotel cone guest house. You are very much left to your own devices but equally Johnny will thoughtfully check in to see all is ok. A glass of wine on night 1 was a  nice touch.
Location and transport wise youll need a car or to pay €10 to €13 for a cab to Shankill to then access buses and rail. *I suggest contacting local cab companies directly and NOT usng ""Freenow""  HORRIFIC lost property experience!*
There is a nice pub 20 minutes walk, half on road without path but do-able, called Farmer Browns which served full menu and drinks.",POSITIVE
Communication ahead of the booking could have been better,NEGATIVE
The location was a bit far for us but otherwise good.,POSITIVE
Nice and quiet. Comfy bed. Hosts lovely,POSITIVE
I don't think you should be advertising that wifi. I could barely send an email,NEGATIVE

Convenient and centrally placed. Very professional and friendly staff. Loved it!,POSITIVE
Everything was great,POSITIVE
We were supposedly upgraded from Barry's to the Belvedere.  Only problem was no wardrobe or coat hangers in room.  Ask at reception but was told that they didnt have any. If this was an upgrade not sure what would have been awaiting us at Barry's hotel.,NEGATIVE
No place or way of hanging clothes.,NEGATIVE
Location. Close to main attractions.,POSITIVE

"everythingâ€”- room, bfast, staff, pizzaðŸ˜Š",POSITIVE
great breakfast and convenient to places!,POSITIVE
"The flat was absolutely perfect. Spotlessly clean, really comfy bed, lovely and warm and very easy to get access. 
Location was great and only €22 for a taxi into centre of Dublin. Also very handy for ppl who need to get to and from the airport.",POSITIVE
"There are many known symbols of Ireland. Harp, Clover, Beer, etc.I think, for today, these were expanded by Alan's smiley, helpfulness, and flexibility! Alan for Tourism President! or at least a national treasure.",POSITIVE
it was everything we needed and more!,POSITIVE
"very easy check in, responsive host and lovely flat. location good too",POSITIVE
nothing,NEGATIVE
The apartment was very comfortable and spacious.  The location was very convenient to the airport.  THe host was very accomodating and gave great recommendations for dining and other requests.,POSITIVE
"Exceptionally clean and comfortable, Alan was very helpful.",POSITIVE
"Alan was a gentleman, met us on arrival with a big smile on his face, gave us a quick tour and let us be. This property goes above and beyond, satellite TV, Netflix, enough fresh towels for full family, Alan even stocked the fridge with bottled water and milk and supplied tea and biscuits, lovely touches. Alan also recommended an Italian restaurant 2 mins from the flat which was belissimo. 20 mins from City Centre during off peak traffic times, very decent location.",POSITIVE

"The apartment is a close drive to the airport and was easy for out early morning flight. 
It was also very clean and comfortable. would definitely recommend staying here.",POSITIVE
"Close from the airport, very cleaned. quiet neighbourhood. very nice owner always here to help.",POSITIVE
the sofa in the leaving wasn’t too confortable but ok for a few nights,NEGATIVE
It had lots of amenities such as hair dryer and iron etc. There was also lots of shampoo and other bathroom products which came in handy as we packed lightly.,POSITIVE
"It was not particularly clean but I think this was only apparent because it is a little run down. It was not all that close to the city centre but still a walkable distance. The host was very blunt, borderline rude. They originally agreed to a check-in from 11am-12pm (our flight arrived at 9am) but this was then revised to 12pm earliest (which I completely understood as previous guests had supposedly left a mess) before being changed to 2pm finally. When I questioned this I was told that standard check-in time was 2pm anyway if I had read the booking details. When we were settled in I was sent a notification of a deposit fee. I completely understand that this is standard practice but as it has not been mentioned before and it was to be sent by PayPal I did think it came across a bit sketchy.",NEGATIVE

Location is great and close to public transportation.,POSITIVE
The property is rather old.  The door is rather flimsy and I feel it can be easily broken into.  The lock is just a simple lock and could easily be jammed open with a piece of metal slip between the crack.  The shower area and one of the sink could be cleaner and the drain wasn't really working that well and pluged up a bit.   Quality of the furniture is rather old and one had a broken leg.  The windows are old and some of the latches almost fell off the hinges.  I don't think they put any investment to upgrade the property.  Even the person who checked us in admitted the property is dated and could be freshen up - Geez.,NEGATIVE
"A nice apartment in the city center of Dublin, with a good distance from the Temple Bar, Trinity College, etc.The apartment has a modern design wiith two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a living room with a sofa bed. The kitchen has a nespresso machine, kettle, tostadora etc. and all you need. There is a SPAR store quite near. It's not a big one, but you find the most important things you need for preparing a meal. The heating, wifi, etc. worked properly. And Jacob was really kind and let us to leave the luggage and make the check out two hours later. Thank you very much for that!",POSITIVE
"Two things: we found a bathroom not cleaned. When we went to use the toilet in the bathroom of the double room we saw that it had been used and the chain had not even been thrown away. It was a bad surprise. I think the cleaning team that manages the apartment is not very good. On the other hand, I think that details are missing to make the apartment really comfortable (for example, putting a shelf in the showers to leave the gel) and also, one of the rooms has the bed placed in such a way that it does not allow to pass. This room is quite unconfortable.",NEGATIVE

The boiler was very noisy,NEGATIVE
"Boden Heath is a self catering apartment on the south suburbs of Dublin. It was easy to locate, and the owner gave full and detailed instructions on how to access the (secure) property.  I felt we got what we paid for. The apartment was comfortable, and though not 'de-luxe' it had everything one might need for a comfortable lodging, including full wi-fi. There is a modern clean lift to the upper floors of the block. We had one or two queries which the owner was very quick to answer, and he even came round to put a slight hiccup right. He couldn't have been more helpful. The flat is around 30 minutes drive from the city centre with all the tourist attractions that make Dublin such a special place and there are numerous bus stops handy with frequent services into town. There are numerous shops, supermarkets and restaurants within easy reach.",POSITIVE
"The decor needs a bit of a spruce-up but that said there is nothing wrong that impinges on one's comfort, so there really wasn't anything to say I ""didn't like"" about it. I would have no hesitation in recommending this flat as a comfortable place to stay, and as the boiler cracks and bangs its way into service, it's even quite ""exciting""!   LOL!",POSITIVE
Michael was very welcoming and easy to talk to. Apartment was very clean and a good place to stay..,POSITIVE
I was given complimentary breaskfast since I am a happy returning client. I also found a nice box of chocolate as a welcome back gift in my room.,POSITIVE

-Accessible location - Has key box for easy access even owner/ host is not available. - owner/ host reachable through text message.,POSITIVE
"- Too pricey for a small room. - The entrance is quite filthy, lots of cigarette butts and rubbish attracting the flies to even goes in to the property. -Quite poor state of the furnitures and kitchen appliances, with multiple pieces of old flooring carpets. Window has a very thin curtain that people could possibly see us through from other property.  - We woke up at the middle of the night due to the noise from people coming in. - WiFi unpredictable",NEGATIVE
"location was great, short distance walk from a lovely little playground which was great for our little one",POSITIVE
great location.,POSITIVE
would have liked if there was a toaster. jacuzzi was difficult to understand but i would recommend asking the owner for help with it before :),NEGATIVE
"There was no breakfast, but the location was very central. They added nice touches like a bottle of wine in the fridge.",POSITIVE
"It was much worse than I expected. Yes the location was very central, but the room was in very poor condition. There were plates, cups, bowls and cutlery all in very good condition. But they should have focused much more on the condition of the flat. It was mostly covered with a very old patchy fitted carpet. The cooker was decades old. The flimsy little curtain over the kitchen sink fell off the wall when I tried to close it the first night. I later went and bought some glue to stick it back on. In any case even closed it really blocked very little light, so when the sun rose very early on the summer mornings the light was immediately brightening up the room. The price was absurdly high for this small run down little space.  Maybe the jacuzzi's great, I wasn't interested in using a jacuzzi but unless you are just enthralled by jacuzzies I don't think that would go very far to make up for all of the other many serious shortcomings.",NEGATIVE
The location was decent.,POSITIVE
"The bathroom had a sewage smell. The beds were uncomfortable. While he was initially helpful by sending a cleaner, the host became hostile when I requested a refund for the unsanitary sewage smell in the bathroom, which made it very uncomfortable.",NEGATIVE

Everything,POSITIVE
Facilities were more than adequate although the shower didn’t seem to get warm…,NEGATIVE
The accommodations are basic with the bathroom and shower down the hall.  The location was great and the price was right.  Very important to bring ear plugs as rooms front right on the road next to the Liffey.,POSITIVE
"absolutely horrendous... the noise and stomping ( if thats what you want to call it... actually no words to describe what it was !!) from the room above us was ridiculous !!People trying to get into our room ! door was locked, but they tried and tried with a key !! i was afraid to go to the bathroom.. which was out on the corridor because of people walking around... the front door being kicked so many times... never againits not a guest house as states in the booking.com its a student accommodation, that rents out rooms at €250!!I'll be going further with this and getting my money back",NEGATIVE

Perfect location.,POSITIVE
"Need a waste bin in bathroom(s), recommend stating on booking website that there is no elevator and to request help for lifting at check out. (The only reason I knew to ask was the hotel before surprised me with no elevator and I didn’t want a repeat.) They didn’t assume I needed help with bringing luggage back down, which would of been nice if they offered.",NEGATIVE
great location,POSITIVE
Toilet in middle section of property did not flush properly,NEGATIVE
"Location was 10/10 couldn't have been closer to the city, really happy with the room so big and spacious. In such an expensive city I was surprised at the great accommodation for such an affordable price",POSITIVE
This accommodation was perfect for a big group. We had everything we needed and was a perfect place to rest after a busy day out on the town. Fair play to the staff for making our stay super easy and comfortable. Would highly recommend this place for a group and so close to everything the city has to offer.,POSITIVE
"The location of this place is amazing, so central and amazing bus links. The staff were so quick with responses and made our stay super pleasant. The bedding was amazing and really enjoyed getting to see the city from our window. Big thanks to all the staff for making our trip unforgettable and we will be returning again!",POSITIVE

The toilet wasn’t flushed whoever used it last. The used tissue papers were floating inside. It gave me an impression that toilet weren’t cleaned before giving the apartment to us and the toilet bleach wasn’t provided I had to buy them.,NEGATIVE

the shower leaked very badly and the floor would be like a swimming pool. no mop or brush to clean it up. hoover didnâ€™t work.,NEGATIVE
"The room was comfortable, all the staff were lovely, the breakfast was great and the location was very good. Very busy at night but you couldn't hear the noise in the bedroom.",POSITIVE
This property was definitely a surprise once you open the door. Very spacious with a private oasis out the back through the sliding glass doors.,POSITIVE
"The property had a lack of very basic items such as bin bags, washing up liquid, salt and pepper.",NEGATIVE
Bob was excellent great to deal with,POSITIVE
"Paid for outside space which wasn't provided. Check in was ok, however, preparation was poor as no towels. Facilities had to searched for and some were found in a cupboard stating it was the property of the owner. Cleanliness was average at best and there was no hot water throughout our stay. a â‚¬400 security deposit was taken which when you sum up the state of the place and the lack of facilities, seems very excessive.",NEGATIVE
"Location was superb, cleanliness very good, very comfortable beds. Easy to find and access to keys to enter brilliant. Parking was fine and nice neighbourhood.",POSITIVE
"Could have done with a few more home comforts ie: rugs on the floor and bigger bath towels! Also few electrical issues with lightbulbs didn't function and toaster tripped the mains. Initial communications with owner were good at first, but during the stay when we had a problem, I got no response. Without these extra comforts, it wasn't value for money (despite booking in high season).",NEGATIVE
"The location suited us very well. It was central for most places, and a short taxi drive from others. The hosts were very pleasant, and very helpful. The apartment had good space and facilities, and accommodated 2 couples very comfortably. It was well-lit and heated, WiFI good and the kitchen was serviceable. Washing machine also very handy. When I asked for a fan (for hot flushes), there was one beside the bed when we arrived. Laura responded almost immediately when I had a problem or needed something.",POSITIVE
"The mattresses are not the most comfortable - a little thin. A change of linen would only be provided at a cost of (as I remember) 40 Euro. It may be less, so I stand to be corrected. But it was of an amount enough to buy an extra set of linen myself. This seemed a little unreasonable, but they did say laundry costs are high. If we'd had an extra set, we could have laundered and dried them ourselves.  Instead of chewing up electricity to dry them before bed-time.It would be helpful  to have some instructions for the microwave, oven etc.  There were a couple of things missing (bedside lights, not enough waste bins), but these are all relatively small issues. And as soon as we requested them, they were delivered pronto.",NEGATIVE

missing rubbish bin in the room or bathroom. Definitely need one. The shower was extremely loud when on, waking me up in the morning. I think the landlady needs to check the electrical Shower.",NEGATIVE
Location perfect for the venue we were attending  - Marlay Park for the RHCP Concert.,POSITIVE

"The main thing for me was the fact we was sharing a top floor flat with the owner, this was not stated on the ad for the hotel. Me and my partner did not feel comfortable at all we felt like we had to whisper the whole time. There was no lock on our bedroom door so we didn't feel 100% safe. We had to share a bathroom with the owner, while we was there she decided to get a bath so the toilet was out of bounds for us. There was no TV or kettle in the bedroom. The pillows are really hard, I ended up using some of my clothes to rest my head on.",NEGATIVE

I request a full refund, as you can see from my history I am a good customer of booking.com and also always leave fair reviews.",NEGATIVE

"The house is lovely and so is the room. It looks freshly renovated, it's clean and cozy and warm with neat bright colour palette. Bathroom also very clean and new. Peppermint tea is a nice touch. Location is excellent since it's only an hour walk from the Hellfire club with lots of green pastures and foresty parts to see on the way. Grocery store just on the other side of the street. Nice view through the window, green fields and cute garden. The host was most helpful and gave us nice tips on what to visit next. Thanks for wonderful stay!",POSITIVE
"I don't recall anything wrong, the stay was very nice. Good value for money.",POSITIVE
"During my stay I became sick with kidney stones,  the owners where very helpful is seeing where and what I needed to do for help.  In addition they took care of my dog with updates as how she was while I was in hospital",POSITIVE
"Not getting sick, hosts where wonderful",POSITIVE
"To be honest, we didn't realize until we arrived there, that aside from the bedroom, we would be sharing living space with the owner.  We usually prefer a bit more privacy.But among possible hosts, we could not have hoped for a better one.  She was very kind and helpful, and provided a lot of helpful advice on places to visit & things to see in the area.And she also engaged us in plenty of stimulating conversation.",POSITIVE
"As mentioned, we had to sacrifice a little privacy; but it was worth it.",POSITIVE
"The serene environment,  view of greenery, host hospitality,  hot water bath,  the wood floor and the food. The room is exactly as it is in the picture.  I strongly recommend this place to other travellers.",POSITIVE

The apartment was fine - it was good to have a kitchen over Christmas as nothing was open.,POSITIVE

There was an unpleasant smell in the pillows,NEGATIVE
Excellent location. Very clean.,POSITIVE
The property was clean and the staffs were friendly. Above all there was a Lidl with 2 minutes walk. Food and other necessities were at arms length.,POSITIVE
Overall I would recommend the property for all tourists.,POSITIVE

"The rooms are a bit small, and there are shared bathrooms that were nice and clean. They have a fully stocked kitchen that you can use on the ground floor.",POSITIVE

gps could not find property. owner was not helpful in finding the property.,NEGATIVE
Wonderful location just across the road from the beach and a short walk from the Dublin Royal Society.,POSITIVE
Nothing,NEGATIVE
Fabulous room. Staff went above & beyond to assist our stay. Food was lovely. Sadly we couldn’t see the lovely views due to the fog - but easy access to the beach and the local village.,POSITIVE

"This property is beautiful, well managed, well kept, clean, and has amazing service. Elena, our host, made us feel welcomed and definitely made our trip better. In addition she gave us help with what to see in Dublin and always made sure we were comfortable and there was nothing we didn’t want or need. The room itself was not only clean but extremely comfortable, the cloud-like beds and the warm shower were so nice after a long day of traveling. The breakfast in the morning is delicious and is specified to your eating habits and/or diet restrictions. If you are deciding where to stay, you should definitely stay here.",POSITIVE
"location and staff and bed was great , slept like a baby",POSITIVE
very modern & neat,POSITIVE
a little warm in the room,POSITIVE
Stayed here for a night as we had a concert in the 3 arena. We were greeted by Elena (hope I’m spelling that correctly) She was so friendly & welcoming. I really couldn’t fault this place at all. Was so modern & clean & so many nice touches in the room it really was more like a hotel than B&B. The breakfast the next morning was lovely too. I will be actively looking for the beach house B&B next time I stay in Dublin. It really is a gem for the price.,POSITIVE
Nothing to dislike.,POSITIVE
"Kitchen door slams behind you. Too small for three ppl. Broken power point. Toaster trips the power - every time.  Tv too small, limited stations.",NEGATIVE

"We had issues finding the lock box.  there was another lockbox in the area described and we were at the wrong one - photo would have helped.  We had issues with no directions for things, like the hot water or washer dryer.  We found written directions on day five behind the cutting boards for the hot water.  The plugs did not work when we arrived, had to reset the breakers. A folder with some information about how to work those things would have saved a lot of frustration.  The US does not commonly have washer/dryer combos, so that was a challenge.",NEGATIVE
"location, modern, clean, roof terrace, good kitchen, spacious",POSITIVE
"Easy self check in and outGreat location, luas next door (doesn't run all night), Guinness is just a few mins away, city  centre 30 mins walking, Lidl 8 mins walking Well equipped, everything needed is there (there is a blow dryer so don't bring one ;) and a washing machine, dish washer)Nice view from balcony! The building where the apartment is feels very safe and well maintained",POSITIVE
"Would be great to get a sheet of house rules, didn't see the wifi password at firstInstructions of how to unlock door (use all 3 keys) would be good, and we couldn't manage to activate the alarm as requested (?) There are some things like shower gel, seasonings, tea etc. in the apartment, we were unsure if guests can use it (so we didn't) Shower was fine just one morning it didn't heat up even after turning heat on and off again as instructed. For the rest of the days it was warm",NEGATIVE

"I slept very well here, the bed was very comfortable, and the host Luca was very nice. I was able to use the washing maschine and tumble dryer to get my laundry done here.",POSITIVE
"The door to the bathroom is a little bit hard to close. Apart from that, I didn't make any bad experiences, just make sure to read the description properly first since there are some specialties here (e.g. that you should check in in the morning hours already).",POSITIVE

"beautiful place for a very reasonable price, very comfy room and helpful and friendly staff.",POSITIVE
"You can share the kitchen with the renters, the hosts and the owner, Who was a funny excèntric character",POSITIVE
"This is not a proper B&B. It's just a house with a smelly bedroom, and the owner didn't have anything ready for breakfast baside some eggs on the frigde (not even MILK)  and some coffee in a drawer. 
The house was cold and had humidity, not comfortable at all. 
And very overprized! 
P.D. In the end, the owner gave us two Doughnuts for the road, and then we discovered one of them has a BITE   xdd",NEGATIVE
"Sorry, but the room as dirty as the bathroom, you habe to share it with 3 male flatmates and it is one houre away from Dublin City by bus. This might be accaptable for 35 Euro but Not for 135 Euro per night. I travel a lot but i have never had such a bad experience in my life.",NEGATIVE

"A disappointing start to my daughters 30th birthday get away couldn’t access the key ( we are intelligent people) but when spoken to like we didn’t understand how to use the key lock via the instructions sent was a little off putting.... however the problem was soon rectified...thank you Sam 
Didn’t have a welcome basket ( bread milk) as other reviewers seem to have had?? Just an opened packet of muffins with 3 missing!!!! “best before date” was the day we arrived (28th!)
Nothing to do with property but avoid weekends if you want quiet... the main door to the building was frequently slamming shut most of Saturday night / early hours  (2/3am) Sunday.",NEGATIVE

"The position is excellent to visit the town. The host was very kind, available and flexible. The room is very confortable and nice. Excellent solution.",POSITIVE

"We enjoyed the old camper very much. It is a retro car, so don’t be surprised that it is an old fashion car, but very well maintained. The technical problems during the check in were quickly solved and fixed. Very friendly owner, he gave us everything we needed for our trip. We had no problem during the check-in and check out. Be careful by planning your trip; the streets and roads are narrow, the average speed is very low.You can use the highway, the highway feels already included in the price. The quality of roads are very good. It is allowed to stay overnight on the way.",POSITIVE
"There is a heavy problem to find a place for overnight staying at some areas, mainly outside of parks.It is recommended to Plan  your trip in advance.",POSITIVE
"Friendly service, available at the times described for pick-up/drop-off. Deposit returned quickly. Renting a camper allowed us to travel around Ireland and see a lot more on a budget.",NEGATIVE
"Specifically Van #1 Scooby: The driver’s seat is unable to adjust as the kitchen cabinet is fixed in place behind it - if you’re tall you will not have a comfortable drive. Combine that with the fact that these vans are indeed retro (30+ years old) and require some manual use of the clutch - you have a tricky drive. 
The ad says that it sleeps 4, if you look at the photos you’d soon see that’s an overstatement. The pop-up tent was old, worn & torn so putting someone (a child/children due to the size) up on that platform would make me feel terrible! It would be cold and damp. 
We didn’t use the fridge as we were afraid of running the van battery flat and being stuck somewhere at our own expense. So to use that/other electrics/heating you need to be at a campsite. We chose to free camp and go without these items.
No TV in the van (not an issue for us, just not as described). 
The descriptions just seem to be a bit ambitious for what is actually provided - so inspect the photos and be a bit pragmatic.",NEGATIVE
"My Mum and I were renting one camper because of the Garth Concert. Compared to available Hotel rooms the camper was really affordable so we gave it a shot.First impression was mixed, we didnt know what we had to expect. When the owner arrived, I was glad and happy. He is competent and could anwer all questions I had. Very good feeling afterwards.Due to the concert and all the visitors we weren´t able to find a suitable camping site so we just stood nearby the croke park, that was not exactly good for comfort but perfect for what we needed.When renting a van, don´t forget to think of camping sites you want to stay, because there you will have heating, sanataries and electricity. All in all it was a great and different experience and for 2 persons it was perfectly fine. But don´t forget to think that they are vintage cars, no high end luxury.",POSITIVE
"The renting site is quite far from the airport, so we had to pay taxi to get us there, maybe it is possible for the owner to get a transport for the guests.On the other hand there is supposed to be a train station nearby so you could reach it with public transport.",NEGATIVE
"We loved travelling in a camper van and seeing Ireland at our leisure. The camper van was older, but comfortable and had all basic amenities. Good value for money compared to other offerings in Ireland. The engine was strong and kept going. Inconsiderate renters caused us to get another camper van than what was originally booked, but Darren was always available for questions and to resolve any issue we had.",POSITIVE
We had here 3 nights and enjoyed this vacation very well. The owner helped us with all we needed. We traveled across the country and it is really amazing and also people there. Parking with van is also very easy. There is a lot of places where you can park for free and have a nice view at the morning.,POSITIVE
"First day unfortunately with first van we get broken engine on the highway in late evening so we were stucked there for a couple of hours. The owner helped us with bringing the second van almost in midnight, unfortunately we were 5 people and second van was just for 4 people. So sleeping was little complicated, but we could continue our vacation. Unfortunately second van had broken battery, so every morning we couldn't start, fortunately the Irish people are awesome and helped us out.",NEGATIVE
-Cool modern camper with all needed amenities and supplies to keep you going- Customer service was great. Really quick replies to all questions-Lovely vintage vibe-Freedom of parking where ever you'd like,POSITIVE
The staff was polite and helpful,POSITIVE
- No written guide or instructions on how to use equipment,NEGATIVE
The staff is very helpful and very communicative. We spent 4 days with the the van travelling around Dublin and Galway and the space is more than enough for two people. The van has everything that you need.,POSITIVE
The up bed wasn't very comfortable. No heating and  at night it was a bit cold (March). Better bring very warm clothes and a sleeping bag to sleep.,NEGATIVE
"Great opportunity for alternative stay in Ireland. We rented Bandit and enjoyed it well. Old style driving with 30+ years car made me remember my first, but everything worked without any problem. Friendly staff with their own service garage. You can get there by Luas tram from central Dublin (red line to Kylemore stop and then approx. 1km walk). Local roads in Ireland are narrow and it's not always easy to find parking, so we planned spots ahead and it paid off.",POSITIVE
"The Bandit has a 2L petrol engine, so you have to take into account the corresponding consumption.",POSITIVE
"Retro Camper Van is the BEST way to see Ireland - plentiful car parks, kind people, come and go as you please. The staff was communicative, and accommodating. Easy to find, pickup and dropoff was a breeze. Plus, how cool is it to roll around the coast in a vintage van? Can't wait to come back!",POSITIVE
I'm tall so the beds were a tad short for my liking. My wife was fine though. Other than that no issues whatsoever! No mechanical issues. One of the cabinets kept opening when going over bumps but this did not affect performance of the vehicle at all.,POSITIVE
"Well equipped mini kitchen with full fridge freezer,microwave etc. Tea, coffee and milk was supplied.",POSITIVE
"This is a single room with 3 beds, the photos were slightly misleading to me, I thought there were 2 separate rooms. All of the furniture is tatty and basic. The bathroom smells a bit mouldy and the shower controls are completely battered and need replacing. Couldn't turn the bathroom light off and this means you can't get total darkness at night. No TV. The host was friendly enough but he turned up to drop off a tumble drying during our stay which was an unwelcome disturbance. The area is nice enough, few shops and restaurants about. Taxi ride into Temple Bar took around 10 minutes. Walking was more like 30 minutes.",NEGATIVE
Good location with plenty of restaurants and supermarkets nearby.,POSITIVE
"The place didn´t look clean at all, we woke up many times because we had ants in our beds. The bathroom´s light couldn´t be switched off which was very annoying at night. But the worst part was the host´s kind of threatening behaviour. The description said that towels were included but the ones they had left in our beds were damp and there weren´t any hand towels in the kitchen or the bathroom either so we opened the cupboards and got some dry towels. The next day after we had already checked out, the property´s owner texted us to say that he was very disappointed because we had used more towels, as the conditions of the property stated that we were not allowed to use them. He also said he might have to charge us 20E extra for this. We looked at the description and it obviously didn´t mention anything about this, he was just trying to overcharge us for his stupid things. I would absolutely avoid this place unless you want to get scammed.",NEGATIVE
The location was a little over 1 mile from the city center.,NEGATIVE
The floors were very dirty and ants were crawling all over the floors. The bathroom light did not turn off. The curtain had explicit writing on it. It smelled like smoke. The shower had hairs in it.,NEGATIVE
The kitchen was fully equipped,POSITIVE
"- the toilet was broken and was flushing CONTINUOUSLY for the duration of my stay
- the toilet has a glass door and there was no way to turn the bathroom light off. In a studio this gets annoying.
- the above points were raised with the owner who did not really care, saying they would have sent someone the day after my departure 
- towels and sheets were a bit smelly
- overall cleanliness was way below average",NEGATIVE
"Proximity to Dublin centre, having a kitchen to make meals, free wifi.",POSITIVE
"Broken fixtures, ants in kitchen, worn furniture, no air conditioning, and no TV.",NEGATIVE

"The property was very cozy, quiet, spacious, and well equipped. It was located only a few minutes from the train station, in a quiet neighborhood.",POSITIVE
the rooms are not soundproof so you can hear the noise coming from the rooms next to you and/or the corridor.,NEGATIVE
lovely staff and lovely rooms,POSITIVE
"The tool shed outside the house was in a pretty rough state, it would look much better if closed at all times. When it comes to property the tap in the kitchen was dripping, which was quite irritating.",NEGATIVE
Beautiful house and great location by the train station,POSITIVE
Watered down soap in the bathroom,NEGATIVE
"It is located in a nice quiet suburb, and noises from the neighbouring rooms didn't disturb my sleep, either. The window blinds allow sleeping in real darkness (not universal in Ireland). The beds were comfortable and long enough for me.We took the whole apartment (all three bedrooms) as a family, so I can't report on sharing the common rooms with strangers; but the common rooms were spacious, the fridge and the kitchen furniture were large enough for five persons, and a door separates the common rooms from the aisle to the bedrooms. There is just one bathroom but that caused no problems in the end. Heating was functional (not universal in Ireland). Wildlife (including foxes) visits the garden.The train station (with at least three trains an hour per direction), a bus stop, a supermarket, and multiple takeaways and restaurants are within a 5 minute walk, it was really easy to get around by public transport resp. get supplies & food.The hosts, though you never meet them in the flesh, respond promptly to email requests.",POSITIVE
"The on-line check-in is cumbersome and confusing, especially when you use a non-touchscreen computer/notebook (the passport scan upload page even had a glitch where you had to step back and forward again for it to load instead of a page meant for phones with cameras).There are no electrical sockets in the bathroom (this seems to be not by design choice but mandated by UK/Ireland regulations) and no mirrors near sockets elsewhere. The hairdryer had a defective plug that overheated quickly, handle with care.Hot water pressure was too low, but this was similar for all places we stayed at in Ireland.Almost twice as much expensive as hotels of similar or higher comfort we stayed at elsewhere in Ireland, but it's Dublin.",NEGATIVE
There were 6 guests but only 5 mugs and no cups. The kitchen was also lacking a couple of utensils (no frying pan),NEGATIVE
great location very clean and very comfortable beds lovely garden view and peaceful,POSITIVE
the only thing it was lacking a couple of basics like tea towels,NEGATIVE
Location was brilliant. Off street parking & the property was just the right size,POSITIVE
breakfast was a tad expensive,NEGATIVE
"Location was excellent. The house good and beds very comfortable. James. who came to cut the grass, was really nice and helpful. The Dart railway station and supermarket are easily within walking distance.",POSITIVE
The kitchen tap dripped and an extra toilet would have been handy. There was no bath mat to step onto when coming out of the shower so had to use a towel. We just about managed to get the TV to work but James told us they are waiting for a satalite dish to be conected. Just a little TLC needed but on the whole very satisfied with the stay.,NEGATIVE
"Absolutely amazing staying here, lovely property and location",POSITIVE
nothing it was perfect,NEGATIVE
The location is really nice and Dublin can be reached by train easily.,POSITIVE
"Well, you can see that it has been used extensively. The furniture etc. has pasted its best years. The water tap in the kitchen was dripping heavily although it was turned off.  The mattresses were very soft and you are sinking into it.",POSITIVE
close to the centre,POSITIVE
"The TV wouldn’t come on, had a lot of messing round to get it working. The wifi again wasn’t working and there was a few different passwords around the living room",NEGATIVE
"The location of the apartment was great, a close walk across the river to the city center. The check in instructions were detailed and helpful. The unit was spacious. Lots great coffee shops near by.",POSITIVE
"The contact for the unit isn’t the owner, it’s a manager. They were responsive during the day, but not on the weekends or after hours. The keys for the unit are in a key locker about a 15 minute walk away that you are required to pick up from and drop off to. This is quite burdensome with luggage. Our keys were not in the key box when we arrived, but they were dropped off 30 minutes after we got in touch with the manager. The bathroom has some water damage and there was some mold in the shower. The couches are worn, loosing their shape, and starting to fray.",NEGATIVE
"Perfect location, street parking available with fees, very clean hotel and excellent staff and a very warm welcome. Very cosy bar and restaurant.",POSITIVE
"Location, facilities,  great apartment  with everything you need.",POSITIVE
Could do with new carpets.,NEGATIVE
"V good location, clean, comfortable + warm. TV services very good. Nice 70s-80s furnishings and services -suited us. Would certainly stay there again because of price and location.",POSITIVE

Cosy and quiet apartment with a nice kitchen. Friendly stuff. Close to the Convention Centre. Would definately come back when I have a conference there.,POSITIVE

several pieces of furniture in the apartment were almost at the point of being broken and could do with replacing.

The apartment had everything we needed for our short stay in Dublin. The location was just spot on. The staff was very pleasant to deal with. Will definitely come back again.,POSITIVE
There were no complaints about this property.,POSITIVE
"Really nice, spacious feeling in the property, beautiful view. It's in the city centre, so it can get noizy - but that's what I expected anyway, and me personally I don't mind. Great communication with the owner and his team. In the apartment lots of thoughtful little touches, as fresh milk prepared and bread, plenty of shower gels and shampoos. I can definitely recommend and hopefully I ll have a chance to visit again.",POSITIVE

the owner and assistant were polite and ready to answer our requests. thanks!",POSITIVE
"-
everything I did not like is not a responsibility of the owner. it is not their fault if
in the streets there are people shouting during the night…. it’s Dublin
the price of the apartment is relatively high… it’s Dublin
the entrance initially disappointed us because we thought we were in a designer place, but again it is not the fault of the owner, who really went the extra mile to make the apartment super cool and our stay as great as possible",NEGATIVE
It is a good walking distance from Dublin city centre and very handy to get to from the airport. Staff were incredibly lovely. Common area is as pictured and top notch. Room had everything you needed really if you are there for one or two nights.,POSITIVE

The apartment itself has everything you will need. It's spotlessly clean and luxurious. The internet is fast and it's spacious.
Book this place. You will not be disappointed!",POSITIVE
We have absolutely no complaints. Genuinely one of the best places we've stayed in.,POSITIVE
"I do feel the pics of the rooms make it feel bigger than what it actually is, it's more like a hotel with little kitchen than an apartment. Room was superficially clean: We were 3 friends traveling together, one had to go on the sofa bed - we had to search for the extra linen that was in a drawer underneath the bed and it was so dusty both in and out, so was the linen sadly. We only stayed there shortly so it wasn't a deal breaker, but the room was tight for 3 - not great value for money compared to other places I've stayed in Dublin considering Dublin is generally overpriced.",NEGATIVE

"Definitely, the attention's anfitrions was the best. To be I'm touch with me all the time to make sure everything was good. They offer help to get to the city center and also to get to the airport. Dublin's gorgeous but with it's weather the things could turn out tiredly so the room was perfect to this situation as was extremely warm and comfortable. See you soon.",POSITIVE
Everything was fine,POSITIVE
"Wow! Hidden gem in Tyrrelstown! 
Super clean, very comfortable beds, have a kitchen with everything you need. 
Walking distance from supermarkets, restaurants, pharmacy. 
34 minutes in car to the City center but..... the bus stop # 7097 is 4 minutes walking and you take the bus 40D and takes you directly to the City Center.",POSITIVE
it would be nice to have outlets to plug your phone on both sides of the bed,POSITIVE
Everything was fine!,POSITIVE
A very plesant staying experience at this place. Claudia and Corneliu were great hosts. They were extremely helpful. The place was neat and tidy. All the facilities were provided. There is also a common kitchen one could use if they wished to. Would definitely recommend this place.,POSITIVE
Nothing that I can think of.,NEGATIVE
The room was so clean the owner was the sweetest person ever. Really good spot to stay at,POSITIVE
free minibar was good. check in/out was well organized,POSITIVE
extremely clean and tidy,POSITIVE
Very nice and comfortable room with beers and snacks for welcome ! We could freely use the big kitchen and the garden. Approximately 50min from the city center,POSITIVE

if we come to dublin again we will be staying here im sure.",POSITIVE
clean and great location close to all bars and restaurants yet still quiet enough,POSITIVE
"A full equiped kitchen with washing machine. Room has a fridge, kettle and a place to sit. Owner is a very nice lady and always available.",POSITIVE
"House is not very soundproof. Some guests are very loud, so was the woman above. I had the feeling there is a big family but was just one person.
A small table would be great.",NEGATIVE
Excellent location in Dublin centre. Short 15 minute walk to Grafton Street. Swimming Pool and gym facilities were great. Nice bar and staff were great.,POSITIVE
Everything was cool.,POSITIVE
location was great,POSITIVE
nothing was very happy,NEGATIVE
Quiet  and clean room as expected but you have to ask not having room facing to the main steet which is busy all time.,POSITIVE
Little bit poor breakfasts. I am using this hotel regurarly since 2016 and it seems breakfast are getting worse.,NEGATIVE
Beautiful hotel with stunning facilities. Couldn’t fault it. also located in a really lovely area close to various entertainment venues. I stayed the night to attend a Carly Rae Jepson concert in the 3Olympia.,POSITIVE
Location and Restaurant downstairs.,POSITIVE
"Room good and cleaned regularly, reasonable location - a little off track for all the main location in Dublin",POSITIVE
At point of arrival there was a clear and obvious error in the booking price versus the price hotel reception were trying to charge myself (difference of approx 300 euros) this took too long to resolve (over 30 minutes) for what was an obvious error on the hotels part.,NEGATIVE
"Lovely hotel, we used the pool which was fab, kids really enjoyed it. Staff were very helpful when booking our taxis and with late checkout. Room was great beds perfect for us and 2 children, really warm and comfy. Location was ideal for us.",POSITIVE
Breakfast wasnt bad but wasn't overly impressive. For a very nice hotel..i expected more. We didn't dine here for dinner but had our breakfast and just a few small things..the coffee tasted more like hot chocolate..not much choice..fruit wasnt overly fresh...but the croissants were beautifully fresh! It was just a bit hit and miss. But the overall atmosphere at breakfast felt a little rushed for me and i felt very little choice apart from traditional fry.,NEGATIVE
we enjoyed our stay at the hotel .,POSITIVE
"While we were in the pool it was lovely but there was a hen party of 9 there at the same time they spent over 2 hours in the jacuzzi and I mean there was 9 of them in the jacuzzi sitting on the side of it with their legs in jacuzzi .  my daughter  spoke with the girl that was on duty at the pool reception .  we were absolutely NOT impressed with her attitude she stated “NOT her problem if you want to go into the jacuzzi it’s up to you to ask them to leave”. Tell me why you have you got a notice up stating only 2 people in jacuzzi at any one time and for only for 10 mins only.   the girl on reception should be keeping an eye on this she had her opportunity to say something to them when she came out to check the temperature of the sauna and steam room.  the other people that was in the pool also were watching their chance to get into the jacuzzi but didn’t get a chance   I would suggest you speak to this girl you will know who I am speaking about she was working at 1pm on Sunday.  we were not the only people that noticed this.
Another problem when we arrived we were not able to pay for our accommodation by tapping my phone . I was asked for my card why can your card machines not be able to take tap by phone . I felt this was very unacceptable as now a days people don’t carry cards with them. for example I could buy a car by tapping my phone.  i hope you sort out these problems if I ever stay with you again.",NEGATIVE
The hotel was lovely and friendly. The gym steam room and sauna were brilliant. And breakfast was very tasty and breakfast was until 11 am.,POSITIVE
Haven’t any complaints,POSITIVE
location,POSITIVE
Our room was cold in afternoon and the heat did not come on till around 17:00. Would be nice to have a Safe in the Room. Staff should check too see if bathroom fan is working. I told front Desk and it was not fixed.,NEGATIVE

No phone jack working  in the room and none available  at reception,NEGATIVE
Very comfortable.. Staff all pleasant. Convenient location.,POSITIVE
"Price of food and drink excessive.
35.00 for a very small steak plus an extra 4.50 for a small portion of chips to go with it?!!
6.80 for a pint of Guinness (moderate quality)
Dined elsewhere on second evening due to poor value for money on first evening.",NEGATIVE
Everything,POSITIVE

The breakfast. It was excellent. The staff in the dining area were friendly and helpful.,POSITIVE

Disappointing to see that no herbal teas were offered at tea/coffee facilities in bedroom",NEGATIVE
Food was good and the staff were very helpful,POSITIVE
Early 11am checkout,POSITIVE
Bar services,POSITIVE
"If basic, away-from-the-bustle, budget accommodation is the game, then DCU is name. This property offers an efficient check-in process, clean room and a varied breakfast, which made for a pleasant stay before heading off to the airport the next day.",POSITIVE
"Room was clean, breakfast was good",POSITIVE
"Room was very hot, despite weather outside not being overly warm. It was also noisy as sound from people talking outside travelled into the room and sounded very loud, despite being on the 2nd floor. There was no dustbin in the room and this would be useful.",NEGATIVE
Good value compared to other hotel options in Dublin. Basic but clean room. En suite. Quite near the bus route to/from the airport. Very pleasant park next to the accomodation. WiFi.,POSITIVE
It is quite far from the centre. No kettle in the room. I booked with breakfast included but for some reason the reception staff thought I was room only so I missed out. (To be fair they rectified this later and offered me lunch vouchers for the meals I missed),POSITIVE
Located in the campus of DCU . Big store  with ale you need (drinks / food)   located in the campus. Additional pub/ restaurant with friendly prices of food/ drinks). There is also kitchen share with others 4 rooms to store the foods/ make coffee/ tea or warm the dishes.,POSITIVE
"We were staying for 3 nights and lift was out of order for the whole staying ( house no 17 floor 4) . With luggage it was really inconvinient.
Additional during the nights horrible noise from Spanish students staying and playining the whole night. Impossible to sleep.",NEGATIVE
"Locatation, breakfast, staff members",POSITIVE
Breakfast was great beds v.comfy too no noise either shower was good i cant fault it,POSITIVE
All gd but a bit of a walk to breakfast .but its under abit of construction so i understand no complaints,POSITIVE

Room temperature was a bit too warm and the need were a bit small for my liking.,NEGATIVE
"The room was comfortable enough, especially the beds. Good cleaning service.  The breakfast was okay, pretty extensive average big English breakfast. It  was also available for take out. , Considering the distance from the airport, the location was very good, a taxi ride costed only 25 euros. Bus 44 departs from the campus every hour and takes approximately 35 minutes to the city center- O; Connolly Street. There is a small supermarket and pharmacy on the campus. The shop offers a variety of necessary articles at very good prices.",POSITIVE
was all very new and clean. Breakfast was lovely with a great selection.,POSITIVE
"What was a bit strange was the absence of electricity sockets in the bathroom. Travelers should also bring a hairdryer with them. The cleaning service was very good, however the cleaners often came early wanting the room to be cleaned by 9.am.There was no option of hanging on the door a do not disturb sign.",NEGATIVE
"What to expect if you stay at an University campus? Right,  not too much comfort. Rooms are perfect to sleep or having a shower. In Dublin you want to visit the city,  so therefor DCU is a perfect place to be. Good public transportation,  several bus lines stop nearby. 15 minutes to go downtown.
Breakfast served in a building that looks like the area reserved for teachers and professors.",NEGATIVE
We had very warm weather. So many students were sitting outside at night which caused some noise. Was better than sleeping beside a busy street but might cause some problems for those who don't sleep very well. But normally this won't happen due to the typical Irish weather. ðŸ˜œ,NEGATIVE
The room and service was great. The breakfast has a convenient price .,POSITIVE
"Hotel really good, breakfast choices excellent, evening menu not as good and not value for money.",NEGATIVE

"If you arrive by taxi or bus that's OK.
Don't bring your car as I feel I was ripped off because I arrived by mine.
I drove in.
I drove out to collect a friend locally. 
I drove in again. 
Next morning I was charged €29.60. 
Pure rip off.",NEGATIVE
location was amazing,POSITIVE
little things could be improved like cleaner gave 2 clean glasses but left old bottle of water with them,NEGATIVE
one of the housekeeping staff walked into our room without knock whilst we were laying naked on the bed! we had already told a housekeeper around 30 mins prior to this that we didn’t need the room cleaned so not sure why another one came straight into our room. was very apologetic but made me feel uneasy that they randomly enter the room when your not there.,NEGATIVE

"The rooms are great, they have the most amazing beds!",POSITIVE
I don’t believe the breakfast was worth the money and the steam cafe wasn’t open the whole weekend I was there which was a shame.,NEGATIVE

"Key collection was very conveniently close by to the apartment. The location was great, a nice short walk into the centre but far enough away that it was nice and quiet to sleep.  Apartment was a good size for 4 people and the sofa bed and bed were both very comfy. Deposit came back very quickly after departing.",POSITIVE
"The shower was awful, the water pressure was a dribble and when it was turned on it was insanely loud. A lot of the plug sockets didn’t work, we could only charge our phones on a couple of them. The blinds needed updating as they were very dirty and stained.",NEGATIVE

"A well-located apartment just off Parnell Square.  The listing is very accurate and what you see is what you get.  We liked it for the two bedrooms plus sofabed setup.  The sofabed turns into a comfy double bed.  Kitchenette has reasonable levels of cutlery, etc..  On the main road so pretty busy with traffic.  Team is the book office very helpful.",POSITIVE

Aliandro the man at the front desk was always very helpful, when I fell down the stairs he rushed to me and promptly help me with my luggage and getting up. He went above and beyond with service, he was always friendly on the phone as well.",POSITIVE
"I like a bath more than a shower, the flexible shower hose could not be moved around very much, it could not be taken out of its cradle. Also I'd have liked some more variety in evening meals offered and a wider range of wines, although we didn't eat in this time if it was very wintery weather we'd have eaten in",NEGATIVE
"Great location, the room was beautiful.",POSITIVE
nothing,NEGATIVE
"Amazing staff, very welcoming and understanding of our needs, we spend the night there after traveling and had an early appointment in one of the embassies nearby, and they facilitated everything and even gave a late check out so we can come back and take a rest and shower before going back home.

Staff were lovely and hotel was extremely clean!  I've always found the staff and cleanliness top class at this hotel. Toiletries great quality too. Close to the city centre. Taxi to 3Arena was €15-€20 - it would be great if the hotel offered a shuttle.,POSITIVE
"The carpark is small and didn't have an spaces left when we got there. However the hotel do mention that the spaces are very limited. 
We were told that a lot of business guests were staying and that they would be gone early in the morning so we could move the car in. However we saw a lot of business people putting their cases in the car and heading off for the day leaving the car in the car park! It was frustrating as if they have checked out, a time-limit should exist in the car park to allow other guests in.",NEGATIVE

The hotel and staff was very welcoming. Clean and good location.,POSITIVE
The staff were really friendly and helpful at the front desk. They went out of their way to assist and held our bags both prior to the room being ready and post check-out. The location was also great; most key sights were within walking distance. It also had a vending machine which was handy for refurbishments.,POSITIVE
Despite it being a deluxe room the bed was a little smaller than used to and on the hard side (although appreciate this can be subjective). We were also expecting more in terms of soaps etc for a 4* and in addition despite being there for over 2 nights when the room was cleaned we didn't get additional paper for the toilet or clean towels (we kept a couple on side but the one in the shower as indicated by the sign was folded and put back on the shelf; it was wet and dirty but not taken).,NEGATIVE

"The hotel is in an excellent location, close to Luas and bus stops and between the Grand Canal and Portobello. The room was spacious and comfortable.",POSITIVE

The property was pet friendly which was absolutely amazing. They place was so clean and the staff we all so friendly. They made such a big deal about our dog Harper and made us feel very welcome with her.,POSITIVE
"I made a special request to say that our dog was coming with us. The hotel replied and said it was no problem to bring our furry friend with us. When we arrived they told us we owed an extra â‚¬50 on top of our room charge for our dog. We have absolutely no problem paying an extra fee for our dog to stay anywhere with us, I think we both would have just liked to have been told beforehand, thatâ€™s all. other than that everything was wonderful!",POSITIVE

Staff was very friendly and really trying to sort out problems.,POSITIVE
"Had to change my room twice. In the first one the bed sheets were wet, in the second one the TV was not wifi connected and couldn’t show Netflix. 
The spa is not to a spa standard really. it’s just an old swimming pool with some saunas. really ran down surroundings. you need to buy a swimming cap and also a lock for your belongings. so it’s not like you go to a spa hotel and relax and don’t think.",NEGATIVE
Staff were so friendly,POSITIVE
"great location, close to all of the interesting attractions.",POSITIVE
locality,POSITIVE
rooms at front very noisy - Kebab shop opposite open until 3.30,NEGATIVE

"great location, very central",POSITIVE
a little bit outdated,NEGATIVE
The location couldn't be more central in Dublin. It is excellent. I stayed over the weekend as I was meeting friends for fun. And I stayed on Sunday night so I could work in the office on Monday morning. So I even got to have a lie on as it was a simple walk to work that morning :),POSITIVE
"I thought I paid the full price when I booked the hotel as I bought a voucher on PigsBack. I felt I paid the whole price as it was an offer on PigsBack. It was about €140. A good price. Then during check in. I had to pay €100 more as I was staying on a Saturday night but if your PigsBack voucher is booked for there on a Saturday, you need to pay €100 extra. So my advice is to book directly with the hotel",POSITIVE

Good services and hosts. Hotel is well located !,POSITIVE
Breakfast is not included and need additionnal fees.,NEGATIVE
Large rooms by European standards. Kind size bed was very comfortable and nice balcony area. Lots of construction going on in the area so quite noisy early in the morning but that will obviously be a short-term issue. Nice touches such as slippers and gowns available and lovely bar area in the hotel. Close to trams so easy to get around.,POSITIVE
Corridor areas are quite tired and could do with new carpeting and a refresh. Only one elevator was working so took some time to get up/down when the hotel was busy.,NEGATIVE

I discovered this discrepancy, and informed the hotel on Monday morning. It was an error on the hotel's side, but I had to bring it to their attention. Not really good enough",NEGATIVE
Lovely place and brilliant location for the Temple Bar area.The car park has direct access to the hotel.,POSITIVE
The hotel car park refund system was not working so had no option but to pay the €42 to exit the car park.,NEGATIVE

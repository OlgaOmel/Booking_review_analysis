Location is very good.","41":"Windows let in a bit too much noise from the street but luckily it\u2019s not a busy street.","42":"Two options for breakfast (Continental and Irish).

We only had 2 soaps, 1 body wash and 1 shampoo. There was no shower cap and for a 4 star hotel we expected to have a body lotion. The breakfast was nice but in our last day, at 9:30 (with still 1 hour to finish breakfast time) we didn\u2019t have any fresh bread left despite the waitress told us that the bread was in the oven.

Location could not be better, next to Luas stop but very quiet.

The price was also fairly reasonable. One half of the building (where Reception is located) is really beautiful, and a nice place to grab a drink and a bite to eat.","173":"The layout of the hotel is a little odd. There is one really lovely half and one NOT so lovely half. Unfortunately, our room was at the very bottom of the not so lovely half. The room itself was okay, although the toilet struggled to flush and the shower bowl filled up with water quickly. We completely understand that the hotel bar gets busy at night, and to be honest we weren't really bothered by that, especially given the hotel's advance warning and other reviews. BUT the noise of doors clanging and footsteps above us both kept us up at night and woke us up in the morning, and that really wasn't acceptable.","174":"comfortable , good location,","175":"noisy at night","176":"The room was clean and spacious.","177":"There was a construction going on beside our room at 6am that woke us up very early then the smell of the paint reeked in the room.

The room was freezing upon arrival until we worked out how to turn on the radiator.

Hotel is lovely from the outside and more stunning inside. The location is just perfect to be in the centre of everything and close to parking etc. Yet we couldn't hear any noise, even on the bank holiday weekend. We will definitely be back and have told everyone about it :)","381":"It didn't annoy us but it might cause others difficulty, we were on the fourth floor and trying to find our room wasn't the easiest but it was fine for us.","382":"lovely hotel in a great location","383":"Tbere was no hot water in the taps but the shower was fine","384":"The staff where very friendly, and we could check into our rooms even though we arrived before noon.

(?). When we were speaking in a normal voice.. Not loudly, no TV, no radio etc. They claimed they had been outside our room and heard us? This was very wierd, and left the impression someone was checking to see if were in the room reported to reception next day.. But no response..","393":"Very clean, beautiful hotel. Staff are amazing and go the extra mile to take care of you. 10 min walk to Grafton street. 15 min walk to Temple Bar. Breakfast was delicious. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely stay again.","394":"We paid extra for the use of the executive lounge. However, it wax only available between 4pm-8pm so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any value from it as we had dinner reservations at 6:30. Most lounges are open all day and have a set time for alcoholic beverages in the evening. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pity we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up bottles of water and snacks throughout the day, as expected.","395":"It was a lovely old building out of town a bit so quiet.

Breakfast was plain but a welcome surprise.","428":"The staff was really polite and helpful. The room had sauna and jacuzzi. The area was very quiet. Even if there\u2019s some traffic on the road just outside the hotel you don\u2019t hear a lot of noise. The aircoach bus stop just outside the door","429":"The room is just in front of the reception so you hear people getting in and the door opening. It takes  25\/30 min walking to get to temple bar. It was nice to get some free breakfast but there was some yoghurt just the first day. Then we had only bread, jam and coffee. Better than nothing anyway","430":"it was great and so clean and comfortable.","431":"nothing.","432":"Staff were very friendly and let us check in earlier to our Room since we had an overnight flight.","433":"Breakfast too basic for Room price","434":"It's in the heart of Dublin.

The accommodations were great and roomy! Had all the amenities of home","498":"Parking","499":"The apartment is vlean and has most facilities needed","500":"Dishwasher was missing wheels in the bottom tray, internet didn't work the first night and tv reception was not good and kept on dropping. There was a lot of noise the second night which kept us awake quite a bit","501":"Super responsive and helpful staff","502":"noisy neighbours yelling and banging on doors at2 am","503":"The apartment was fine - it was good to have a kitchen over Christmas as nothing was open.","504":"It took a bit of a walk to collect the keys - luckily it wasn\u2019t raining and we arrived during the day. The Temple Bar area is not that interesting - lots of businesses had closed, possibly due to pandemic.","505":"The location was great, in the heart of Temple Bar. Very convenient.  Bedroom was also good. That's about where it ended, unfortunately.","506":"Kitchen door slams behind you. Too small for three ppl. Broken power point. Toaster trips the power - every time.  Tv too small, limited stations.","507":"location, modern, clean, roof terrace, good kitchen, spacious","508":"only one key which was inconvenient, especially on nights out when people wanted to retire at different times.","509":"The position was excellent, in the centre of Dublin, and direct to reach from the airport. Nevertheless silent all day\/night long! A beautiful flat.","510":"We booked for 4 people, but just two flew to Dublin. So the apartment was perfect, but if we were the whole family... there were no wardrobes at all, and it would have been too small.","511":"Location is great. Right in the center and with river view.","512":"Beds were really uncomfortable both sofa and twin beds, main window was dirty.","513":"It was easy to check-in and get the keys. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I do appreciate that they stayed open later since our flight landed late.","514":"To get to the location to get the keys was an extra 13 minute walk to the rental office and back.

Very cosy bar and restaurant.","523":"Nothing.","524":"The apartment had everything we needed for our short stay in Dublin. The location was just spot on. The staff was very pleasant to deal with. Will definitely come back again.","525":"It is a good walking distance from Dublin city centre and very handy to get to from the airport. Staff were incredibly lovely. Common area is as pictured and top notch. Room had everything you needed really if you are there for one or two nights.","526":"I do feel the pics of the rooms make it feel bigger than what it actually is, it's more like a hotel with little kitchen than an apartment. Room was superficially clean: We were 3 friends traveling together, one had to go on the sofa bed - we had to search for the extra linen that was in a drawer underneath the bed and it was so dusty both in and out, so was the linen sadly. We only stayed there shortly so it wasn't a deal breaker, but the room was tight for 3 - not great value for money compared to other places I've stayed in Dublin considering Dublin is generally overpriced.","527":"The staff were outstanding and so easy to deal with couldn't do enough for us.","528":"Great location, in the centre of Dublin, but just far away from the busy streets to feel some privacy and quiet. As it is an aparthotel the room had great amenities, and the room was much larger than I thought it would be! Would recommend to a friend!","529":"Perhaps a bigger option of food\/snacks downstairs","530":"everything was over the top: easy, calm, comfortable, clean, accessible, friendly, silent\u2026","531":"it would be nice to have outlets to plug your phone on both sides of the bed","532":"clean and great location close to all bars and restaurants yet still quiet enough","533":"Excellent location in Dublin centre. Short 15 minute walk to Grafton Street. Swimming Pool and gym facilities were great. Nice bar and staff were great.","534":"Everything was cool.","535":"location was great","536":"nothing was very happy","537":"Quiet  and clean room as expected but you have to ask not having room facing to the main steet which is busy all time.","538":"Little bit poor breakfasts. I am using this hotel regurarly since 2016 and it seems breakfast are getting worse.","539":"Beautiful hotel with stunning facilities. Couldn\u2019t fault it. also located in a really lovely area close to various entertainment venues. I stayed the night to attend a Carly Rae Jepson concert in the 3Olympia.","540":"Room good and cleaned regularly, reasonable location - a little off track for all the main location in Dublin","541":"At point of arrival there was a clear and obvious error in the booking price versus the price hotel reception were trying to charge myself (difference of approx 300 euros) this took too long to resolve (over 30 minutes) for what was an obvious error on the hotels part.","542":"Lovely hotel, we used the pool which was fab, kids really enjoyed it. Staff were very helpful when booking our taxis and with late checkout. Room was great beds perfect for us and 2 children, really warm and comfy. Location was ideal for us.","543":"Breakfast wasnt bad but wasn't overly impressive. For a very nice hotel..i expected more. We didn't dine here for dinner but had our breakfast and just a few small things..the coffee tasted more like hot chocolate..not much choice..fruit wasnt overly fresh...but the croissants were beautifully fresh! It was just a bit hit and miss. But the overall atmosphere at breakfast felt a little rushed for me and i felt very little choice apart from traditional fry.","544":"we enjoyed our stay at the hotel .","545":"While we were in the pool it was lovely but there was a hen party of 9 there at the same time they spent over 2 hours in the jacuzzi and I mean there was 9 of them in the jacuzzi sitting on the side of it with their legs in jacuzzi .  my daughter  spoke with the girl that was on duty at the pool reception .  we were absolutely NOT impressed with her attitude she stated \u201cNOT her problem if you want to go into the jacuzzi it\u2019s up to you to ask them to leave\u201d. Tell me why you have you got a notice up stating only 2 people in jacuzzi at any one time and for only for 10 mins only.   the girl on reception should be keeping an eye on this she had her opportunity to say something to them when she came out to check the temperature of the sauna and steam room.  the other people that was in the pool also were watching their chance to get into the jacuzzi but didn\u2019t get a chance   I would suggest you speak to this girl you will know who I am speaking about she was working at 1pm on Sunday.  we were not the only people that noticed this.\nAnother problem when we arrived we were not able to pay for our accommodation by tapping my phone . I was asked for my card why can your card machines not be able to take tap by phone . I felt this was very unacceptable as now a days people don\u2019t carry cards with them. for example I could buy a car by tapping my phone.  i hope you sort out these problems if I ever stay with you again.","546":"The hotel was lovely and friendly. The gym steam room and sauna were brilliant. And breakfast was very tasty and breakfast was until 11 am.","547":"central location","548":"Haven\u2019t any complaints","549":"location","550":"service","551":"Beautiful hotel build in an old monastery. Space, clean and comfortable rooms. All was good and the stuff too. Great location, Bus station in front of the hotel, straight to the city center in less 10 minutes.","552":"No phone jack working  in the room and none available  at reception","553":"Very comfortable.. Staff all pleasant. Convenient location.","554":"Price of food and drink excessive.\n35.00 for a very small steak plus an extra 4.50 for a small portion of chips to go with it?!!\n6.80 for a pint of Guinness (moderate quality)\nDined elsewhere on second evening due to poor value for money on first evening.","555":"Everything","556":"The hotel needs freshened up","557":"The breakfast. It was excellent. The staff in the dining area were friendly and helpful.","558":"The shower. It was adequate but not exceptional.","559":"Staff were friendly and the hotel was only 5 minutes walking distance from dart station.\nAlso conveniently located for local convenience store and pubs which also served food","560":"Restaurant area was lacking atmosphere, bar area was too big and not very warm. There was nowhere comfy to sit and read a book which seems to be lacking in most hotels these days.\nDisappointing to see that no herbal teas were offered at tea\/coffee facilities in bedroom","561":"Food was good and the staff were very helpful","562":"Early 11am checkout","563":".","564":".","565":"Bar services","566":"If basic, away-from-the-bustle, budget accommodation is the game, then DCU is name. This property offers an efficient check-in process, clean room and a varied breakfast, which made for a pleasant stay before heading off to the airport the next day.","567":"Bed quite uncomfortable","568":"Room was clean, breakfast was good","569":"Room was very hot, despite weather outside not being overly warm. It was also noisy as sound from people talking outside travelled into the room and sounded very loud, despite being on the 2nd floor. There was no dustbin in the room and this would be useful.","570":"Good value compared to other hotel options in Dublin. Basic but clean room. En suite. Quite near the bus route to\/from the airport. Very pleasant park next to the accomodation. WiFi.","571":"It is quite far from the centre. No kettle in the room. I booked with breakfast included but for some reason the reception staff thought I was room only so I missed out. (To be fair they rectified this later and offered me lunch vouchers for the meals I missed)","572":"Located in the campus of DCU . Big store  with ale you need (drinks \/ food)   located in the campus. Additional pub\/ restaurant with friendly prices of food\/ drinks). There is also kitchen share with others 4 rooms to store the foods\/ make coffee\/ tea or warm the dishes.","573":"We were staying for 3 nights and lift was out of order for the whole staying ( house no 17 floor 4) . With luggage it was really inconvinient.\nAdditional during the nights horrible noise from Spanish students staying and playining the whole night. Impossible to sleep.","574":"Locatation, breakfast, staff members","575":"Breakfast was great beds v.comfy too no noise either shower was good i cant fault it","576":"All gd but a bit of a walk to breakfast .but its under abit of construction so i understand no complaints","577":"Good location for an overnight stop. Ideal when catching an early morning flight. Didn't have a chance to experience breakfast but we had a few drinks and food at the restaurant on campus which was very nice and reasonably priced.","578":"Room temperature was a bit too warm and the need were a bit small for my liking.","579":"The room was comfortable enough, especially the beds. Good cleaning service.  The breakfast was okay, pretty extensive average big English breakfast. It  was also available for take out. , Considering the distance from the airport, the location was very good, a taxi ride costed only 25 euros. Bus 44 departs from the campus every hour and takes approximately 35 minutes to the city center- O; Connolly Street. There is a small supermarket and pharmacy on the campus. The shop offers a variety of necessary articles at very good prices.","580":"What was a bit strange was the absence of electricity sockets in the bathroom. Travelers should also bring a hairdryer with them. The cleaning service was very good, however the cleaners often came early wanting the room to be cleaned by 9.am.There was no option of hanging on the door a do not disturb sign.","581":"What to expect if you stay at an University campus? Right,  not too much comfort. Rooms are perfect to sleep or having a shower. In Dublin you want to visit the city,  so therefor DCU is a perfect place to be. Good public transportation,  several bus lines stop nearby. 15 minutes to go downtown.\nBreakfast served in a building that looks like the area reserved for teachers and professors.","582":"We had very warm weather. So many students were sitting outside at night which caused some noise. Was better than sleeping beside a busy street but might cause some problems for those who don't sleep very well. But normally this won't happen due to the typical Irish weather. \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0153","583":"The room and service was great. The breakfast has a convenient price .","584":"Hotel really good, breakfast choices excellent, evening menu not as good and not value for money.","585":"Choices of good in Jasmine bar and cost of food, sandwiches \u20ac15.75 isn\u2019t good value","586":"I liked the hotel. I liked the room. That's about it.","587":"If you arrive by taxi or bus that's OK.\nDon't bring your car as I feel I was ripped off because I arrived by mine.\nI drove in.\nI drove out to collect a friend locally. \nI drove in again. \nNext morning I was charged \u20ac29.60. \nPure rip off.","588":"location was amazing","589":"little things could be improved like cleaner gave 2 clean glasses but left old bottle of water with them","590":"Room was tired","591":"location","592":"I liked it","593":"Comfort and excellent breakfast","594":"All good","595":"Great location","596":"Bathroom was very outdated.

However the hotel do mention that the spaces are very limited. \nWe were told that a lot of business guests were staying and that they would be gone early in the morning so we could move the car in. However we saw a lot of business people putting their cases in the car and heading off for the day leaving the car in the car park! It was frustrating as if they have checked out, a time-limit should exist in the car park to allow other guests in.","794":"Wonderful staff! Very accommodating to unforeseen situations, and took care of us very well. The location is also great, in a nice and safe area just a short walk to the city center.

Clean and good location.","823":"The staff were really friendly and helpful at the front desk. They went out of their way to assist and held our bags both prior to the room being ready and post check-out. The location was also great; most key sights were within walking distance. It also had a vending machine which was handy for refurbishments.","824":"Despite it being a deluxe room the bed was a little smaller than used to and on the hard side (although appreciate this can be subjective). We were also expecting more in terms of soaps etc for a 4* and in addition despite being there for over 2 nights when the room was cleaned we didn't get additional paper for the toilet or clean towels (we kept a couple on side but the one in the shower as indicated by the sign was folded and put back on the shelf; it was wet and dirty but not taken).","825":"The location, quick check in and helpful staff","826":"Basic toiletries in the washroom.

In the first one the bed sheets were wet, in the second one the TV was not wifi connected and couldn\u2019t show Netflix. \nThe spa is not to a spa standard really. it\u2019s just an old swimming pool with some saunas. really ran down surroundings. you need to buy a swimming cap and also a lock for your belongings. so it\u2019s not like you go to a spa hotel and relax and don\u2019t think.","914":"Staff were so friendly","915":"great location, close to all of the interesting attractions.","916":"locality","917":"rooms at front very noisy - Kebab shop opposite open until 3.30","918":"Location is great, walking distance to mostly everything!

It is excellent. I stayed over the weekend as I was meeting friends for fun. And I stayed on Sunday night so I could work in the office on Monday morning. So I even got to have a lie on as it was a simple walk to work that morning :)","923":"I thought I paid the full price when I booked the hotel as I bought a voucher on PigsBack. I felt I paid the whole price as it was an offer on PigsBack. It was about \u20ac140. A good price. Then during check in. I had to pay \u20ac100 more as I was staying on a Saturday night but if your PigsBack voucher is booked for there on a Saturday, you need to pay \u20ac100 extra. So my advice is to book directly with the hotel","924":"Some small maintenance issue light burn marks around the lights and shower rail loose","925":"The location was great and the staff were very friendly.","926":"The rooms were a little noisy from the hallway and the street.","927":"Location was what I wanted.

It was also quite busy.","945":"The staff were super attentive and friendly","946":"Good services and hosts. Hotel is well located !","947":"Breakfast is not included and need additionnal fees.","948":"Large rooms by European standards. Kind size bed was very comfortable and nice balcony area. Lots of construction going on in the area so quite noisy early in the morning but that will obviously be a short-term issue. Nice touches such as slippers and gowns available and lovely bar area in the hotel. Close to trams so easy to get around.","949":"Corridor areas are quite tired and could do with new carpeting and a refresh. Only one elevator was working so took some time to get up\/down when the hotel was busy.","950":"Very cosy our triple room, comfortable bed and different pillows for us to choose according to our preferences. excellent view directly to Christchurch and gardens. Very good soundproof windows m.\nVery good breakfast and excellent very friendly and prepared staff.","951":"room was fine. The only fault was the window did not close properly","952":"I didn't like being charged twice for the room. I have no idea why this happened. We stayed on a Saturday night and the money was refunded to my account on the following Thursday. I discovered this discrepancy, and informed the hotel on Monday morning. It was an error on the hotel's side, but I had to bring it to their attention. Not really good enough","953":"Lovely place and brilliant location for the Temple Bar area.The car park has direct access to the hotel.","954":"The hotel car park refund system was not working so had no option but to pay the \u20ac42 to exit the car park.","955":"Room clean, warm & plenty of hot water. This is the 3rd time we have stayed at this particular hotel and would definitely recommend it.

Further, the bed was super comfortable.","977":"The space between the bed and the window as well as the window itself weren't too clean. Apart from that we would have liked to be able to open a window. It would have been nice to get some fresh air, especially after cooking or showering.","978":"Our initial stay was disappointing due to some equipment faults. However, when bringing this to the attention of the manager, he promptly offered us a full refund.","979":"The faults have all been addressed.","980":"The staff was so friendly the moment we arrived and were so helpful, throughout our stay.The room was lovely & a wee added bonus having a fitted kitchen.\nHairdryer, iron & ironing board all stored in a large drawer under the bed. \nThe room was very clean & a comfy bed.\nThank you to all the staff including housekeeping for their cleanliness.\nperfect location.","981":"No fault.","982":"the style of the room and how close it was to everything!","983":"price","984":"lovely staff and spotless hotel","985":"Absolutely fantastic boutique hotel to stay in while in Dublin.

The hotel is in a great location, just a 10 to 15-minute walk from Grafton St. The room was newly renovated so lovely and fresh. Great shower.","991":"The pillows, I know it is a small thing, but they did affect my nights sleep. They were too big and hard. The hotel is being renovated and there was some noise but it was limited. A holder in the shower for shampoo, etc, would also benefit the fab shower.","992":"Great style, atmosphere and location\nVery attentive staff","993":"Breakfast was a bit short of options for the continental\nThe bed was not that comfortable with the two mattresses and the gap in the middle. It was a bit too soft.","994":"quality","995":"Beautiful property, not a far walk(20-30min) or bus ride(10-15min) from the city center and 30-40 min to the airport.

The hostel is well equipped also if you want to cook for yourself. There is a bus stop just outside from which you can take the bus to the airport and the centre is within walking distance. There is not much extra personal space in the room and the walls are quite thin but for a short stay it is no problem. Staff was very helpful too.","1020":"At night you could hear every little noise","1021":"I had a great time staying at Gardiner House! It's a little off the beaten path but staff helpful.

The accommodations were absolutely stunning in the Georgian house which had such a fun and vibrant ascetic. Our bathroom was fitted with stunning (perhaps even heated?) marble with a lovely shower, which opened up to a double bedroom with a glorious floor to ceiling window, a generously sized plush bed, and a huge mounted tv to boot! The location was perfectly situated around incredible restaurants and a very navigable bus route to get just about anywhere in Dublin in under 25 min, not to mention Delia's phenomenal daily breakfast! Our last day of our stay she was even kind enough to leave us with an early pot of coffee, fruit, and bread after calling us a taxi to the airport.

We were at the front of the hotel so it was louder so if you\u2019re bothered about noise then ask to be in a back room.","1166":"I chose this hotel for its proximity to where I was working but also because of its location amidst the pubs and restaurants for which the Temple Bar area is famous.","1167":"I chose a room with two double beds as I was sharing with a friend.  It did not have the city view as advertised but, maybe because of that, it was very quiet and we did get a very good night's sleep.  The beds were also very comfortable.  There was no fridge and there was only one bed-side light in between the two double beds.  One bedside light on either side of the beds would have been better so that one person can read if the other wants to go to sleep.   This room would not win any prizes for interior design but it was clean and comfortable and the location was excellent.","1168":"Nice hotel \nClean \nCentral location \nFriendly staff","1169":"There was a strange damp smell in the hallways, which was awful.  \nCheck in and check out was a little all over the place\nLast time i stayed here there was a little welcome treat bag in the room which there wasn't this time.

They offered us heaters and extra blankets but this was not adequate. It is not want one expects when paying 1,500 Euro per week.","1181":"There was a drainpipe right outside the window. When it rains the noise is unbearable and one can't sleep On four occasions I had to sleep in the living room. I had to take the cushions from the sofa and put them near the door as this was the only darkish spot. Could not sleep on the couch as there are only net curtains and too much light gets in even at night, street lights etc.When the extractor fan over the cooker is turned on, dirt covers the food that you are preparing. Looks something like sawdust.Extractor fans in the bathroom did not work nor did the towel railThe heating system has a mind of its own. Had to call a technician in to the set it up right. He advised that it was all set up wrong. And even after he fixed it\/set up the controls right, the heating was still all over the place e.g. you set the heat for 21degrees it still wouldn't raise above 19.If I wasn't to busy I would have moved elsewhere. The place is not fit for purpose.But if you like your food covered in sawdust, sleepless nights and erratic room temperatures, then this is the place for you.","1182":"L\u2019appartamento era nuovo e ben arredato, bagni grandi e doccia super confortevole. Utile, per un soggiorno lungo come il mio, la presenza di lavatrice\/asciugatrice, lavastoviglie, microonde, e altro, ed anche di una pulizia omaggio dell\u2019appartamento a met\u00e0 soggiorno. Ottima la posizione in un quartiere elegante e ben servito da bus e treno (utile per escursioni fuori citt\u00e0), circondato da locali eleganti anche di sera.

We were at the front of the hotel so it was louder so if you\u2019re bothered about noise then ask to be in a back room.","1207":"I chose this hotel for its proximity to where I was working but also because of its location amidst the pubs and restaurants for which the Temple Bar area is famous.","1208":"I chose a room with two double beds as I was sharing with a friend.  It did not have the city view as advertised but, maybe because of that, it was very quiet and we did get a very good night's sleep.  The beds were also very comfortable.  There was no fridge and there was only one bed-side light in between the two double beds.  One bedside light on either side of the beds would have been better so that one person can read if the other wants to go to sleep.   This room would not win any prizes for interior design but it was clean and comfortable and the location was excellent.","1209":"Nice hotel \nClean \nCentral location \nFriendly staff","1210":"There was a strange damp smell in the hallways, which was awful.  \nCheck in and check out was a little all over the place\nLast time i stayed here there was a little welcome treat bag in the room which there wasn't this time.

Bed was uncomfortable","1233":"location was excellent","1234":"Breakfast was excellent as always location not to far from train station no complaints","1235":"The rooms are adequately spacious. The pub area is nice. The staff are friendly.","1236":"The building is under refurbishment and this was not made clear during the booking process. The parking on site is very very tight and due to refurbishment equipment in the car park it was difficult to park without damaging other cars.","1237":"Good location for shopping and eating out. Not too much of a walk from Temple bar either. Room was clean","1238":"Noisy builders very early on a Monday morning due to work being done on floor 2.

This could be better signposted- Shower temperature was hard to control, also small shower so I ended up knocking the handle and making it so hot it scolded me","1270":"Breakfast was great","1271":"Traffic noise","1272":"Very comfy and well appointed bedroom, sitting above a pretty cool cafe. Breakfast in cafe was included, I had eggs Benedict, was really really nice. would stay again.","1273":"Cafe is basically the reception, shuts at 5pm, so need to make special arrangement if checking in after that. informed that via booking.com messages, but still seems a little restrictive. If locked out, could be awkward. But basically same as Airbnb, so if you\u2019re careful you\u2019re ok.","1274":"Doesn't have a lift, so is hard if you have alot of luggage.","1275":"Staff very friendly.\nLovely breakfast and room very clean.","1276":"Shower drain did clog.","1277":"Price was good. Coffee was great.","1278":"It\u2019s a very rough part of town at night. I was afraid to leave at dark. Feels unsafe. There is not 24 hour reception, so that feels uncomfortable to me.

This was a pity because every other aspect of stay was excellent","1299":"All the staff who work on the bar were so lovely and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. The building itself is really impressive and in a quiet area of town. Complimentary g&t was a nice surprise!","1300":"The staff on the front desk weren\u2019t very welcoming when we arrived at the hotel. The room had been prepaid for as an Xmas present for my partner but the desk staff opened with asking me to pay the full amount again. which was a bit embarrassing as he was standing there. \nAlthough the room is as advertised as Small, it is Very Small for \u00a3200+ a night. and no bath.","1301":"The Wilder is a beautiful old building in which every little detail is designed with a lot of taste, it\u2019s only a 15 min walk to the central area; the room was small but comfortable, the breakfast was very good, we recommend it!","1302":"Great location, charming architecture.","1303":"The room was quite small, but we were able to make it work well enough.","1304":"The ambience,the location,the attention to detail","1305":"Absolutely nothing!","1306":"v helpful staff","1307":"not much","1308":"Breakfast was lovely, staff were really nice.","1309":"Tables were a little close to each other.

Hotel is in a fantastic central location but still in a calm, quiet street.  Room was nice and spacious with a big bed and a sofa.  Breakfast was delicious with more than enough great food to keep you going.","1312":"The bed was big with a good, firm mattress (two singles pushed together) but was in desperate need of a mattress topper as it was just too hard.  Bath towels were tiny and only just big enough for a child.   We paid a promotional price for the room but would have been very disappointed if we had paid the full price.","1313":"Breakfast","1314":"Having to book this when we did not know.","1315":"Elegant hotel, beautifully appointed with attentive staff. Location was great especially good food at the adjacent Dunne & Crescenzi restaurant","1316":"Had a cosy standard room at the top of the house. It was small but very well laid out with plenty of storage for a short stay, and decorated beautifully. As it is an old townhouse there are no lifts in the building, so perhaps request a lower floor room if three flights of stairs sound alot.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fabulous in a modern restaurant at the back of the building. The location was excellent - close to shopping, restaurants, and travel links. And despite its central location it is on a quiet street.","1317":"breakfast was amazing and location was perfect","1318":"nothing","1319":"room, location and breakfast","1320":"view","1321":"Excellent great table service","1322":"Room at back  -construction site noise during nightv","1323":"Beautiful and comfortable","1324":"Location, staff , comfort .

The bed was comfortable and the amenities in the kitchen were great, the apartment had everything you needed.","1343":"It was a little further from the city centre than we expected but still not too long to walk. And public transport nearby. We had the basement room which i would have preferred not to have but was ok. However there was a lot of rubbish outside the room window, with an exit that you couldn't use. Not the most practical if you dont like stairs as we had to go up and then back down to get into our apartment in the adjacent building.","1344":"Clean and comfortable.","1345":"Friendly staff. Good facilities. Spacious room.","1346":"Noisy basement room, when paid extra for quiet larger room. Bathroom was dated.","1347":"The apt was very spacious and clean with very good facilities - the kitchen was extremely well stocked with everything you could need - appliances, utensils, crockery, tea and coffee etc etc; the bed was big and comfortable; there was a sofa and table and chairs; there were 2 big windows with easy-to-use blinds; the heating was excellent - just need to press a switch to get heat from a radiator (central heating); the location is good - a quick 10-minute walk from the top of O'Connell Street; the staff I met were pleasant and helpful and it's nice to be able to come and go as you please without necessarily having to pass by a front desk at reception...","1348":"The flush in the toilet was rather weak; the position of the safe in the wardrobe meant that you couldn't hang things properly; can someone tell me which is the shower gel - body cream or body lotion...?!All in all I would really recommend this place and stay again...","1349":"it was such a nice building and very clean","1350":"The room was what I expected.

We had arrived early and the hotel did everything that could to ensure that we could get in as early as possible. The room was tidy and clean","1366":"The walls of the hotel are very thin! this is the only downfall. You can hear everything through the walls especially the cleaners. It isn't a big let down but just something we noticed.","1367":"Location was good.","1368":"The check in\u2026Was told our room wasn\u2019t going to be ready until 4pm. The boy at the desk did not seem phased at all as we had reservations at 4pm. He finally changed our room so we could get in earlier (3:30pm).","1369":"Location is excellent","1370":"It could do with the carpets being cleaned, there were stains etc. We had stayed here in August and we thought they had deteriorated, but a simple fix is a good deep clean and a lick of paint on stains etc.","1371":"Everything , spotless clean , great shower","1372":"Directions to accomodation very confusing why dont directions say its on HARRY ST., because i had read booking . com reviews and reviews mentioned confusing  directions i was aware of this difficulty otherwise i would be checking for NON EXISTANT entrance on Grafton St.","1373":"Location \u2026. it\u2019s right in the middle of the city center . 500 Mts from trinity college .","1374":"it\u2019s awfully small , not suitable for more than 3 people with even medium size luggage .","1375":"Amazing location!

There was a balcony but no key so couldn\u2019t use.","1408":"Easy to find & good location!

There was a bus stop right outside the lodge, and the DART trains were about a 10 minute walk. The Dublin Bay was a 7 minute walk away and was absolutely beautiful. The owners were so helpful, extremely nice, and very knowledgeable about things to do in the area. The room was serviced everyday and was very clean, the shower pressure was fantastic and the bed was very comfortable. I would absolutely stay again.","1513":"I had such a lovely stay at the beautiful and charming Aberdeen Lodge. Ann & Pat were so friendly and welcoming - Ann greeted me with tea and homebaked cookies, and she gave me the best! sightseeing tips perfectly fitted for my personality and preferences.

I would come back anytime to enjoy the gorgeous quiet classy surroundings, the nice neighborhood with great public transportation and the warm hospitality - hopefully soon!","1514":"Welcoming with warm drink made us feel very welcome.

Great staff and wonderful breakfast.  Warm welcome.  Loved petting the goldens!","1527":"Only negative if I had to say would be the bathroom needs a little attention around the tub molding.  Not a deal breaker as everyone deals with keeping caulking white.  Bathroom was very clean.  Another concern as with other places we have stayed, was hot and cold water pours into sink or tub separately.  Quick fix was to draw the bath prior to entering tub to avoid risk for scalding from hot water spout.  Note this is not a complaint, merely a caution as we found very common in Ireland.   \nNote:  Would not recommend for persons with mobility issues due to need to climb multiple stairs.","1528":"Hotel 7 was clean and modern with very friendly and helpful staff!

We arrived an hour early, which we were aware check in was not until 2 but we wanted to leave in our bags. The man on reception spoke to us rather rudely and did not appear to want to give us the time of day. We are a young couple, and I believe that this possibly may have been the reason we were not treated in the same way as other couples might. There was no \u201cwelcome to Lansdowne hotel, enjoy your stay\u201d. Instead, our initial \u2018welcome\u2019 included an irritated look on this member of staff\u2019s face and a sneer as he informed us \u201clads you\u2019re too early for check-in, we\u2019ve to sort out other people first\u201d.

The room was serviced everyday and was very clean, the shower pressure was fantastic and the bed was very comfortable. I would absolutely stay again.","1678":"I had such a lovely stay at the beautiful and charming Aberdeen Lodge. Ann & Pat were so friendly and welcoming - Ann greeted me with tea and homebaked cookies, and she gave me the best! sightseeing tips perfectly fitted for my personality and preferences. She had Enya on her playlist during breakfast hours at the restaurant - I loved that! and the home-cooked breakfast was amazing!! I would come back anytime to enjoy the gorgeous quiet classy surroundings, the nice neighborhood with great public transportation and the warm hospitality - hopefully soon!","1679":"Welcoming with warm drink made us feel very welcome. Fulfilling breakfast with exceptional variations. Also, very friendly service.","1680":"Room was a bit cold for our likening. There was no toilet brush.","1681":"Homely, welcoming feel & I loved the fresh lilies!","1682":"I would prefer more eco-friendly products & fresh milk in a small jug as opposed to plastic pots. Reduce waste.","1683":"The Aberdeen Lodge was perfectly located close to the Dart to easily access Dublin and other nearby neighborhoods.","1684":"Nothing, Ann and Pat were lovely and I adored my stay here.","1685":"Aberdeen Lodge is a charming place in the beautiful residential area of Sandymouth very close and very well connected to downtown. The environment, familiar and full of charm, offers all the services for a wonderful stay, including a truly unmissable \u00e0 la carte breakfast. The rooms are super comfortable and cosy and the staff are really nice and helpful. Special thanks to Pat for his support and really invaluable help. We hope to see you again in the beautiful Dublin soon!","1686":"Nothing","1687":"A beautiful property in a lovely borough of Dublin. The furnishings are comfortable and fit the character of the property. Breakfasts are exceptional. Super helpful and friendly staff, and the family who run the lodge are gracious and also helpful. I felt very at home in my cozy room and with the resident pets, Robin, Sandy, and Coco.","1688":"Our hosts were helpful, friendly and exceptionally nice!  Breakfasts were fabulous.  The owners gave us helpful suggestions on how to tour the city. We got necessary wake up calls and they called taxis for us as needed.  The two golden retriever \"greeters\" were sweet friendly dogs and we posted their photos on Facebook.  I'd recommend this nice B&B to anyone visiting Dublin.  Sincerely,Mike & Nancy Branigan","1689":"Everything was perfect , the best breakfast i have ever had.","1690":"nothing","1691":"Location just outside the city.  Parking on site.  Great staff and wonderful breakfast.  Warm welcome.  Loved petting the goldens!","1692":"Only negative if I had to say would be the bathroom needs a little attention around the tub molding.  Not a deal breaker as everyone deals with keeping caulking white.  Bathroom was very clean.  Another concern as with other places we have stayed, was hot and cold water pours into sink or tub separately.  Quick fix was to draw the bath prior to entering tub to avoid risk for scalding from hot water spout.  Note this is not a complaint, merely a caution as we found very common in Ireland.   \nNote:  Would not recommend for persons with mobility issues due to need to climb multiple stairs.","1693":"The hotel itself was extremely comfortable, the rooms were lovely and spacious. the staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful. thoroughly enjoyed my stay.

Everyone from the reception to the restaurant and the floor attendants was very friendly. I had indicated during the booking that it was our anniversary, so they left chocolates in the room for us, and we were very happy. Restaurant food was amazing. I would love to go again.","1727":"The only problem was that the room was so hot, we couldn't control the temperature. The bed was very comfortable but the sheets were burning. In general, everything was very good.","1728":"everything was very modern and new.  rooms very secure.  robbery of rooms nearly impossible. i had a comfy en suite single and paid only $75 per nite.  cheap by dublin standards.  while most of the clientele are young, nights were very quiet.  its not in the city center but walking not too far or can use the frequent bus service with stops 3 minutes walk away.  the communal kitchens were pretty well equipped to cook simple meals or use microwave for frozen meals.  super market and convenience stores only 5 minute walk. had large fridge.  kitchen was always spotless.   nice gastropub adjacent to property.","1729":"there was a lot of new highrise construction in the area.  so location not quaint.","1730":"Good location, good staff, room is clean and have some good restaurant nearby","1731":"washing machine is hard to use, and I lost my two coats:(","1732":"Stayed here twice, each time had different issues..Blinds broken, bed broken, shower not working,...I get that it is student accommodation..","1733":"Long check out queues, difficultt o get an iron.","1734":"Position is great, staff super friendly and kind, security is good.

Kitchen clean and a lot of different activities in the shared room such as ping pong table and chilling area.","1735":"we were 2 friends and the bed was a bit 2 little for the 2 of us, the room was advertised for 2 people, but the bed was actually pretty small for the 2 of us. Besides that everything is great!","1736":"Affordable , good location","1737":"Bed wasn't a standard double bed","1738":"The \"student\" room had not been lived in in months, and was covered everywhere in dust.","1739":"Security, and low-key management approach.","1740":"It was quite and peaceful, comfortable bed and very nice and spacious .","1741":"The fridge had a very unpleasant smell, we didn\u2019t end up using it .","1742":"I loved the location. Really safe and cool neighborhood. It's also a short walk to the center of the city.  I stayed here to attend an event at Trinity College Dublin, and I adored the walk to Trinity. Lovely cafes along the way. Very walkable location. I really liked the courtyard.","1743":"The kitchen lacked some materials to make cooking convenient. Some facilities, like the kitchen and other (indoor) common areas were a little dirty. Our shower had a little mold, too. Nothing that was a deal breaker. I look back on my 2-week stay at Destiny Student - New Mill with fond memories.","1744":"Friendly and helpful staff","1745":"It was quite far from the city centre\nThe shower wasn't very hot\/powerful\nLots of the light switches in the room didn't work","1746":"Only the location.","1747":"The fact the room was not cleaned or prepared properly.

When we asked about it at reception they said they can\u2019t program another key, that the owner doesn\u2019t want to spend money on it as it\u2019s a single student room during the academic year. The thing is they charge over 200\u20ac per night so for that price we should be getting what we paid for. There is one kitchen for 4 rooms but only 2 cups, 2 plates and two spoons, forks, etc, ridiculous. We chose this place because it said it has fully equipped kitchen (we needed some stuff for the baby) but kitchen was barely empty and there was no soap to wash the dishes.","1756":"clean, not many amenities, small bed , basic, but that what is advertised as student so you get what you pay It seemed expensive but Dublin hotel prices at the time were way higher so in that sense good value","1757":"room a little small","1758":"Able to walk to St Patrick\u2019s, Trinity College, pubs, shopping, St Stephens Green, and more!","1759":"A bit hot and stuffy with window closed, but too noisy with window open.","1760":"Location","1761":"Noise","1762":"Towels had to be Rented\nNo Travel Supplies in rooms, toothpaste etc,","1763":"The room was clean and everything was functional and useful. The room is a standard student accommodation, not too big, but good enough for 2 people for one or 2 nights. Dublin is not that big and from the city centres you could walk for 15 minutes to the accommodation.","1764":"Unfortunately the prices are ridiculous in Dublin regarding the accommodation, but the check-in and check-out hours are unpleasant for this accommodation in particular. If you do such a late check-in, the check-out should be at least 11pm. Unfortunately you also have to pay 5 euro for luggage storage, for a few hours.","1765":"rooms clean and tidy and nice modern Decor and complimentary tea and coffee which was a nice touch","1766":"the noise on the street was VERY loud and i couldnt sleep either night , when you do drop off people are up and slamming the doors really early the doors are really loud when they close i had a complete lack of sleep which was impacting the fun i could have around dublin \u00a320 deposit o my my card for a minature fan the beds are really small as a double this is explained but combined with heat and very noisy rooms was quite stressful","1767":"Perfectly clean, cousy, very friendly owners and staff.

Excellent bed mattress, great location to explore Dublin... All main attractions plus pubs, restaurants, cafes are within easy walk to reach. \n*** All around the country the sockets are U.K. style, bring an adaptor along to avoid xtra costs! Most of the accommodations sockets have also a USB port but not all devices (i.e. some Apple devices) can be recharged directly via USB","1778":"Room n bathroom too small! The shower cabin and sink are really petit!\nOverpriced for what one gets but then again this is Ireland and in general expensive times we are going through...","1779":"The staff were very friendly and the room was nice and clean and spacious.","1780":"Nothing","1781":"Wonderful helpful friendly staff, really made you feel welcome.The room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable.The location was great and very close to O'Connell St, really good for shopping and sight seeing.","1782":"Could do with a small tea\/coffee tray in the room , they do offer hot drinks but you have to ask in reception , were as i would rather of made my own in the comfort of my room in the morning, saying that there is a really good coffee shop across the road open from 7am called Koffee & Kale, which made really good breakfasts and coffees.","1783":"There are no comments available for this review","1784":"Disponibilit\u00e9 de l'h\u00f4te pour l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'appartement","1785":"","1786":"Host was contactable and easy to chat to.

Fantastic breakfast in the wooden whisk.\nKevin was very accommodating. Very quick to reply.\nLovely city break.","1789":"Sadly all six of us every morning had luke warm  showers. \nAs 6 people are expected to all sleep in the lounge area on the sofa beds you would think a mirror could be provided.","1790":"je recommande","1791":"","1792":"Posizione centrale, alloggio sfruttato bene.

Beds were great, but furniture in shared living area was not.  It has two couches.  Both are so low to the ground that it is hard to get off and onto them.  The first couch is literally broken and had a piece of 2x4 holding it up.  The second is newer and in better shape, but still extremely low to the ground.  The apartment was missing some basics that I would expect - parring knife, a functional bread knife (we had one but too dull to cut bread).  The frying pans were old teflon with lots of scratches.  I wouldn't and didn't use them.  Outside of not delivering key information until two days before arrival, our contact person was good, very nice and responsive to concerns we had about a breaker for the bathroom lights that was tripping on a regular basis.  However, there is only so far a good host can go when the furniture is uncomfortable.","1922":"Good location. The manage did his best to fix the kitchen tap that was broken.","1923":"The couch was broken and the bed in one room was uncomfortable, made a terrible noise when you sat on it and annoying when you were sleeping.","1924":"convenient. friendly and welcoming","1925":"very small room but cosy and clean","1926":"Nice room, comfy bed, decent shower. 15 minute walk into centre of Dublin. Good pub downstairs!","1927":"Very nice and helpful staff, the pub downstairs is great for a late night beer and the location is great, as it is within a 15 minute walk to the center","1928":"Small bed and stairs too steep","1929":"Staff were so friendly and helpful. Good location, short easy walk into city centre.","1930":"No breakfastWe knew this","1931":"More hooks in bathroom","1932":"Location clean \nThe guy that booked us in was so friendly","1933":"There was nothing we didn't like\nBreakfast would have been a nice add on but wouldn't stop us going back","1934":"Clean and comfortable, no bells and whistles and above a lovely pub. Staff were fantastic and bent over backwards to help us","1935":"Excellent","1936":"Nothing","1937":"Excellent location yet quiet at night. Fantastic staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Incredible value for the price.","1938":"Lovely clean and comfortable room. Good heating so was nice and warm. The shower is lovely. The staff member carried my bags to my room and made conversation which was super nice.","1939":"Arrived early to drop off my bags and the place was completely locked up. I rang the number on the door sign that said \"ring this number if you want to drop off your bags early\" and it was invalid which was really annoying, and concerning that you can't even gain access to the hotel at all before 3pm.","1940":"the large room, high ceilings and big windows that opened.","1941":"coffee machine was great but was not monitored or refreshed. twice I asked for milk and had to ask to have the grinds removed- it\u2019s a lovely touch, but only if it is usable.","1942":"Booked a single room for a 2 night stay. It was clean and warm, bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was clean and modern, shower had hot water when needed","1943":"Walls are very thin, you can hear almost everything from outside the door or from the next room.","1944":"room was clean and good location","1945":"quite old fashioned and some of the reception staff weren\u2019t very friendly","1946":"Everything was alright, but flush in the toilet did not work","1947":"I liked the easy check in, even before 14:00.The room was also very nice. Was what we expected.","1948":"The windows could be improved. It felt like they were open when they weren't (sound)","1949":"close to temple street hospital and also private parking.","1950":"very very warm, window was open all night and fan was going all night. radiators weren\u2019t even on.","1951":"overall very nice place and enjoyable stay, the location is pretty good for walking to the O\u2019Connell St area of theatres and shops etc, check in very nice and the room had everything you need! it\u2019s a quiet area.","1952":"the room is quite small but then it\u2019s a single room, bathroom good size. There could be a few more coat hangers in the room.","1953":"The bed was very comfortable and the room was warm.","1954":"Very large room in a delightful grand old townhouse, with high ceilings and decorative furnishings. Deep carpet, comfortable beds, and excellent bathroom facilities. Tea and coffee provided with complimentary biscuits, and friendly staff. The whole family slept very well. Excellent location, about 20-30 minutes walk north of the Ha'penny Bridge and Temple Bar.","1955":"The lighting could have been better. There was a single bulb illuminating the centre of the room, and although there were bedside lamps, not all of them worked, and one of the plug sockets (admittedly out of site behind one of the beds) was broken and looked distinctly unsafe. Not everybody wants bright lights of course, but it's nice to have the option.Also, if your curtains are 10 or 12ft high it's quite a good idea to fit some sort of drawstring mechanism. I guess there's probably a knack to it, but this old man actually managed to wrench his shoulder trying to draw them.Also, there is a dining area downstairs, but it's tiny. We brought back a takeaway one night, and I felt like I was eating in a converted closet.Little niggles though, overall it was excellent.","1956":"Cleaness","1957":".....","1958":"El alojamiento inmejorable! La cama muy comoda y la ubicaci\u00f3n buena, 25 minutos a pie y 12 en tranv\u00eda. \nTodo el apartamento estaba en una condiciones excelente y la anfitriona muy atenta y simp\u00e1tica.","1959":"","1960":"great personnel, very nice ppl and helpful","1961":"-","1962":"The Location is perfect to walk,well connected with the most interesting places to visit","1963":"The room is small, without wardrobe, it is fine for a week-end but not for longer stay\nThe sink in the toilet too small","1964":"good location. friendly staff.","1965":"very noisy.","1966":"Location was perfect, good walking distance to most places. Beds were super comfy :)","1967":"position, clean, warm","1968":"Sound insulation is not good enough","1969":"Great location and lovely staff.","1970":"Perhaps needed some more facilities in the bedroom, such as hooks or shelves or sitting areas \/ chairs.","1971":"The location","1972":"Nothing","1973":"Great location, comfy beds","1974":"Bathroom extractor fan didnt work, coffee machine kept eating capsules","1975":"the room in attic a bit slanting and not flat, the side table lamp fell down itself midnight.","1976":"It was so handy. Perfect for both my appointments at the mater","1977":"Was not mentioned that it was opposite the garden of  rememberance","1978":"Amazing, would highly recommend! Perfect for our group of 6. The location was ideal for what we wanted\u2026right in the middle of Temple Bar. It does get loud around this area but for a group of 24 year olds that\u2019s exactly what we wanted so we wasn\u2019t fussed at all. The apartment was extremely clean and had all furnishings needed. Thanks for our stay, we will be back for sure.","1979":"Nothing :)","1980":"great location, nice apartment very spacious","1981":"no one\u2019s fault, the street is noisy at night till early hours","1982":"was perfect location, very clean and nice apartment","1983":"was a couple things not working and slightly worn but besides that was great","1984":"Great central location in temple bar and spacious flat meant for 7 people it was a comfortable stay for 3 nights. Clean and modern facilities with lots of useful things like an iron and hair dryer, and even tea, coffee and milk on arrival!I booked several months ahead and had a few questions and clarifications I wanted from the host during this time. They are very quick to reply, helpful and professional.","1985":"Not a problem for us but given central location may be noisier for people staying on sofa beds as fronts onto main bar street area. Picking up keys first at different location was a little more work but not hard to find or too far away.","1986":"Great location, really in the centre of Temple Bar.","1987":"No hot water, it tripped out day 1. It was repaired really quickly but ran out quickly. cold showers for three days.","1988":"Fantastic, spacious apartment at the heart of Temple Bar. Walking distance to all the city centre attractions, and bus stops round the corner.","1989":"A bit noisy outside the living room, but that\u2019s to be expected staying in such a busy area for bars and restaurants. Noise at night from people coming in and out the building was irritating. Wi-Fi signal needs boosting as it was unreliable did didn\u2019t cover the whole apartment.","1990":"It was central to temple bar, perfect location for all entertainment.\nApartment was spacious and furnished well","1991":"Lack of hot water on weds morning","1992":"The location","1993":"Right in the heart of temple bar, huge apartments with big living area and big bedrooms. Very comfortable for a group of 4-6","1994":"Very noisy given the location - constant partying and construction in the evenings and mornings. The bathrooms are in need of a refurbishment as they\u2019re worn out and low quality.","1995":"Great location roomy and cleanEasy access to most place\u2019s especially temple bar Guinness house was easy to reach also","1996":"Little noisy on some nights and the seagulls will drive you mad every morning they wake you up","1997":"The room was spacious and beautifully decorated. All staff were nice . \nWe stayed a few nights. One morning we had to leave the hotel at 6am to go on a day trip.They set a breakfast table for us at 5.30 am, including hot coffee. What a wonderful service!","1998":"was spotless and warm. as requested a lovely quiet room on the ground floor. staff were lovely.","1999":"Great breakfast, lovely clean room, friendly and helpful staff","2000":"Nothing it was all great!","2001":"Everything. It is real gem in the middle of Dublin, where so so accommodations are the norm. Finding a place sparkling clean, beautiful, affordable and comfortable place is rare. I hope they keep their standards and prices!!!","2002":"All was perfect.","2003":"The room was cute and quaint. My reservation came with free breakfast which was delicious. The staff was very friendly.  The location was nice as well. Not in the thick of things, but I could easily walk all over Dublin and get to the hot spots within 15 minutes or less.","2004":"The staff were amazing, wonderful welcome upon late checkin, room was small but warm, clean and comfortable, at breakfast (really good) the next morning the staff were making a real effort and I witnessed many moments of kindness by the staff which is so refreshing to see. It made me want to visit again.","2005":"Great breakfast.

It is very close to all the temple bar activity but on a quite block where you can sleep. It is 1\/2 block to the river and about 5 blocks to Temple bar main area. The apt was very clean and functional. Overall excellent. I would stay there again.","2031":"Nothing.","2032":"Great location, easy to get to, very comfy beds. Loved the fact that there was some real coffee, not just the instant stuff, that we could make ourselves in the morning","2033":"No issues.","2034":"Wonderful location. Very nice host.","2035":"A little a bit more cleaning would be great.","2036":"The location was excellent and the accomodation was comfortable.","2037":"Firstly, there was a problem with the communication on arrival. We were told that we would be met at the appartment on arrival. I therefore sent messages to the number given to me by email about our time of arrival but received no reply and had to phone the host after our arrival to find out how to access a key.\nSecondly, we were unable to access a wifi connection and a message to our host requesting help was met with no response. There appeared to be an issue with the modem\u2019s security which needs to be addressed.","2038":"It was a good location, close to the city center, shops and restaurants. The apartment was fairly sized with enough sleeping spaces for everyone in my party","2039":"The bathroom was a bit dated and needs some TLC","2040":"Great location for Temple Bar area, very accommodating!","2041":"There was no breakfast included. The apartment was pretty roomy and relatively quiet. Easy to get to. The manager is a little slow to answer emails and texts, but easy to reach by phone.","2042":"The kitchen is not very well equipped for cooking, but it's adequate as long as all you're doing is eating breakfast there.","2043":"location","2044":"wifi didn\u2019t work most of the time and had to reset hot water heater, so cold shower the last morning. property manager didn\u2019t communicate quickly.","2045":"Location very nice","2046":"Nothing","2047":"great location and easy access","2048":"nothing","2049":"The comfort of the rooms and the detail inside every room. You do not need anything more. The shower is amazing. The dishwasher. The washing machine. The style. The location. I loved every minute of my stay.","2050":"Some front office staff can be a bit more friendly. Tara was amazing!","2051":"Given facilities and service were excellent.","2052":"not having parking spaces.","2053":"really friendly and helpful staff,","2054":"The location is excellent, wanted to be a bit out from the center for a quieter time. Tram & bus stops right outside so transport options are really good. Is very close to 3Arena and omniplex etc but thankfully from hotel you could not hear any noise.","2055":"The kitchen area looked really good at first but attention to detail was lacking somewhat. Half empty bottle of water in fridge. Very limited tea\/ coffee for a stay that was a few days. Cutlery was not cleaned fully and there were still bits of someones food on them, especially the forks. There were fake tan stains all over the bathroom door also. The pillows were super uncomfortable to be honest. We did ask for extra in advance so we could hopefully switch them round to suit but they never gave us any.","2056":"I loved the shower","2057":"Having a broom in the room.","2058":"Fantastic property, perfect location for anyone going to a concert in the 3arena. Luas right outside the door too. Great facilities in the building too!","2059":"Needed the same card that was used for the booking but it was paid by the company I work for so I didn\u2019t have it with me. When I was booking, there was nothing to say that I wouldn\u2019t be charged in full at the time of booking and that it wouldn\u2019t be charged until I checked in. I then needed to use a personal card despite having my work card details just not the physical card. Quite annoying to stay our trip.","2060":"This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.","2061":"Great value for money.  Very convenient when going to the 3 Arena.","2062":"Brilliant hotel, next door to 3 arena, and right beside a train stop.","2063":"The location is great, at the front of the building is a bus station and a tram. There are also shops and restaurants itd. It is 25 min walking to the centre. Apartments have all that you could possible need for a short or a long stay. In is quiet.","2064":"You could hear all the voices from other apartments - loudly and clearly.","2065":"Great spacious twin room. Very clean room and enquire.  Great location and multiple travel options.  Bus stop just outside main entrance. 10min walk to Ranelagh luas.  25min walk to Grafton St.Really friendly staff, very knowledgeable about the area.Nice restaurants nearby for breakfast\/ lunch.Aldi and Lidl next door to Travel Lodge.","2066":"The location and the value for money. The staff were also very helpful.","2067":"No comments","2068":"The room was spaciousThe location was good in relation to the city centre","2069":"The room was cold and it took a long time to figure out how to use the heaterThe toilet did not flush too well","2070":"The room was large","2071":"you could hear all the noise through the door","2072":"Great location, clean and comfortable room with private bathroom, great wifi. every comfort was provided.","2073":"The room was clean and warm and the bed was comfortable.","2074":"I didn't like the grubbiness of reception area and lift. Although the reception staff were nice and  friendly and helpful.","2075":"Location is brilliant,  staff were very helpful, overall very good value for money.","2076":"Staff was super friendly and kind (all the different people we met in the reception during our stay). The location is very nice because the hotel is located to an independent neighborhood but it is also close to the main city center (\"The Temple Bar\" it's about 25 minutes on foot). Bus stops are exactly in front of the hotel while you can find supermarkets and restaurants everywhere around the hotel!","2077":"The only thing I can think is that some nights I could use a different (harder) pillow. Besides that everything else was super nice and comfortable!","2078":"good value stay near to some good facilities","2079":"our room was a bit cold and there really are no thrills to a Travellodge","2080":"This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.","2081":"It was quiet, cozy and quaint. The location is good.","2082":"Nothing, really. You do have to coordinate to gain entrance but that is not a big deal.","2083":"Great location, lovely spacious luxurious room. It can be a bit noisy but to me that\u2019s all part of staying in the middle of temple bar and just adds to the atmosphere.","2084":"Having to check in at a specific time is a bit restricting but after that minor inconvenience it was just a lovely stay in a lovely room","2085":"Will furnished, secure, and quiet","2086":"Could do with a better shower","2087":"great location, bed is very comfortable. we were surprised that even though is located in Temple bar area it was very quiet during the night.","2088":"The shower\u2019s pressure was very low, kept changing the temperature from super hot to cold on its own.","2089":"Central location and yet possible to sleep uninterrupted in an area that never sleeps!!!","2090":"Lack of instant coffee sachets. We did not manage to master the coffee machine despite detailed instructions and had to go out and purchase some instant coffee. Could have called housekeeper but just didn\u2019t, as prefer instant coffee anyway.","2091":"Incredible location in the heart of Temple Bar.","2092":"Having to set a time to meet to check in was a bit inconvenient.","2093":"close to the centre of Dublin \nvery good charm and character \nsurprisingly quiet given it was in the nightlife area of the city","2094":"no bath to enjoy after the cold days out sightseeing!\na long walk up the stairs, but that kept us fit!","2095":"the bed was amazing","2096":"the stairs were long but that can\u2019t be helped","2097":"Very well located in Temple Bar, but so well insulated you couldn\u2019t hear the noise.","2098":"The room was lovely and big. Very quiet since the location is central Temple Bar. The staff were lovely and eager to help us in anyway possible.","2099":"A small issue of the bathroom door didn't close fully, left a gap around which didn't give the privacy you would like when using a bathroom. The shower kept going from cold to hot in waves also. I think this is due to the low pressure.","2100":"Was a great break away as a family","2101":"Didn\u2019t not like anything","2102":"El chico que gestionaba los apartamentos muy agradable y atento ,respondiendo a cualquier duda que nos surg\u00eda.

The flat was tired and in need of an update such as broken furniture and a window that had a missing handle so couldn't be locked or properly opened.\nThe walk between the key office and flat is 20 mins which makes it difficult with suitcases.","2112":"The apartment was clean, comfortable and in a good district. We very much enjoyed our stay, even with a few small inconveniences.","2113":"The check-in process is terrible. The office where you pick up your keys is more than a 20 minute walk from the apartment itself. This is not made clear and may require two taxis, one to the office and a second one to the apartment. Inside the apartment some of the cabinet faces were delaminated. The temperature inside the building is extremely hot, and there are minimal controls in the room. We had to open the doors and windows and keep the heat turned off to achieve a comfortable temperature when the outside temps ranged from 16 to 23 in late July.","2114":"Spacey rooms, 3 bathrooms, all kitchen amenities you need","2115":"Loud water \"pump\", the sheets had some dirty spots on them","2116":"Great location, close to food and transit. We always love being able to get an apartment to spread out and be able to cook our own food. A grocery store is right down the street. It was just what we needed.","2117":"Very minor but the hot water and heat cut off after an hour of being turned on.","2118":"Great location, very cosy apartment and very good facilities. Ideal for a family or 2 couples.","2119":"Collecting the apartment key at a different location.

Also, because it is student accommodations there were very loud gatherings at all hours of the night. Not the properties fault! Just something to be aware of if you\u2019re a light sleeper","2138":"Very convenient and large room (apparentely a room for disabled persons). Quiet place. Convenient public transport facilities nearby (Luas tram, buses) ofering easy ways to get to downtown in Dublin city.","2139":"No possibility to simply make  tea or coffee in the room nor in the common kitchen. Which is useless when you are just travelling. We just came down from the plane in the evening and of course did not travel with breakfast stuff. Should be more convenient for people staying there a longer time.","2140":"Student accommodation in a convenient area \nwith en-suite bathroom. Considering the prices \nof Dublin accommodation this was good value. \nFriendly and helpful staff.","2141":"The room is in a shared flat so it\u2019s noisy \n(the doors bang and make a loud noise).

They are very quick to reply, helpful and professional.","2235":"Not a problem for us but given central location may be noisier for people staying on sofa beds as fronts onto main bar street area.

Walking distance to all the city centre attractions, and bus stops round the corner.","2239":"A bit noisy outside the living room, but that\u2019s to be expected staying in such a busy area for bars and restaurants.

It is very close to all the temple bar activity but on a quite block where you can sleep. It is 1\/2 block to the river and about 5 blocks to Temple bar main area. The apt was very clean and functional. Overall excellent. I would stay there again.","2261":"Nothing.","2262":"Great location, easy to get to, very comfy beds.

Very nice host.","2265":"A little a bit more cleaning would be great.","2266":"The location was excellent and the accomodation was comfortable.","2267":"Firstly, there was a problem with the communication on arrival. We were told that we would be met at the appartment on arrival. I therefore sent messages to the number given to me by email about our time of arrival but received no reply and had to phone the host after our arrival to find out how to access a key.\nSecondly, we were unable to access a wifi connection and a message to our host requesting help was met with no response. There appeared to be an issue with the modem\u2019s security which needs to be addressed.","2268":"It was a good location, close to the city center, shops and restaurants. The apartment was fairly sized with enough sleeping spaces for everyone in my party","2269":"The bathroom was a bit dated and needs some TLC","2270":"Great location for Temple Bar area, very accommodating!","2271":"There was no breakfast included.

Tram & bus stops right outside so transport options are really good. Is very close to 3Arena and omniplex etc but thankfully from hotel you could not hear any noise.","2285":"The kitchen area looked really good at first but attention to detail was lacking somewhat. Half empty bottle of water in fridge. Very limited tea\/ coffee for a stay that was a few days. Cutlery was not cleaned fully and there were still bits of someones food on them, especially the forks. There were fake tan stains all over the bathroom door also. The pillows were super uncomfortable to be honest. We did ask for extra in advance so we could hopefully switch them round to suit but they never gave us any.","2286":"I loved the shower","2287":"Having a broom in the room.","2288":"Fantastic property, perfect location for anyone going to a concert in the 3arena. Luas right outside the door too. Great facilities in the building too!","2289":"Needed the same card that was used for the booking but it was paid by the company I work for so I didn\u2019t have it with me. When I was booking, there was nothing to say that I wouldn\u2019t be charged in full at the time of booking and that it wouldn\u2019t be charged until I checked in. I then needed to use a personal card despite having my work card details just not the physical card. Quite annoying to stay our trip.","2290":"This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.","2291":"Great value for money.  Very convenient when going to the 3 Arena.","2292":"Brilliant hotel, next door to 3 arena, and right beside a train stop.","2293":"The location is great, at the front of the building is a bus station and a tram. There are also shops and restaurants itd. It is 25 min walking to the centre. Apartments have all that you could possible need for a short or a long stay. In is quiet.","2294":"You could hear all the voices from other apartments - loudly and clearly.","2295":"Great spacious twin room. Very clean room and enquire.  Great location and multiple travel options.  Bus stop just outside main entrance. 10min walk to Ranelagh luas.  25min walk to Grafton St.Really friendly staff, very knowledgeable about the area.Nice restaurants nearby for breakfast\/ lunch.Aldi and Lidl next door to Travel Lodge.","2296":"The location and the value for money.

Although the reception staff were nice and  friendly and helpful.","2305":"Location is brilliant,  staff were very helpful, overall very good value for money.","2306":"Staff was super friendly and kind (all the different people we met in the reception during our stay). The location is very nice because the hotel is located to an independent neighborhood but it is also close to the main city center (\"The Temple Bar\" it's about 25 minutes on foot). Bus stops are exactly in front of the hotel while you can find supermarkets and restaurants everywhere around the hotel!","2307":"The only thing I can think is that some nights I could use a different (harder) pillow. Besides that everything else was super nice and comfortable!","2308":"good value stay near to some good facilities","2309":"our room was a bit cold and there really are no thrills to a Travellodge","2310":"This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.","2311":"It was quiet, cozy and quaint. The location is good.","2312":"Nothing, really. You do have to coordinate to gain entrance but that is not a big deal.","2313":"Great location, lovely spacious luxurious room. It can be a bit noisy but to me that\u2019s all part of staying in the middle of temple bar and just adds to the atmosphere.","2314":"Having to check in at a specific time is a bit restricting but after that minor inconvenience it was just a lovely stay in a lovely room","2315":"Will furnished, secure, and quiet","2316":"Could do with a better shower","2317":"great location, bed is very comfortable. we were surprised that even though is located in Temple bar area it was very quiet during the night.","2318":"The shower\u2019s pressure was very low, kept changing the temperature from super hot to cold on its own.","2319":"Central location and yet possible to sleep uninterrupted in an area that never sleeps!!!","2320":"Lack of instant coffee sachets. We did not manage to master the coffee machine despite detailed instructions and had to go out and purchase some instant coffee. Could have called housekeeper but just didn\u2019t, as prefer instant coffee anyway.","2321":"Incredible location in the heart of Temple Bar.","2322":"Having to set a time to meet to check in was a bit inconvenient.","2323":"close to the centre of Dublin \nvery good charm and character \nsurprisingly quiet given it was in the nightlife area of the city","2324":"no bath to enjoy after the cold days out sightseeing!\na long walk up the stairs, but that kept us fit!","2325":"the bed was amazing","2326":"the stairs were long but that can\u2019t be helped","2327":"Very well located in Temple Bar, but so well insulated you couldn\u2019t hear the noise.","2328":"The room was lovely and big. Very quiet since the location is central Temple Bar. The staff were lovely and eager to help us in anyway possible.","2329":"A small issue of the bathroom door didn't close fully, left a gap around which didn't give the privacy you would like when using a bathroom. The shower kept going from cold to hot in waves also. I think this is due to the low pressure.","2330":"Was a great break away as a family","2331":"Didn\u2019t not like anything","2332":"El chico que gestionaba los apartamentos muy agradable y atento ,respondiendo a cualquier duda que nos surg\u00eda.

The flat was tired and in need of an update such as broken furniture and a window that had a missing handle so couldn't be locked or properly opened.\nThe walk between the key office and flat is 20 mins which makes it difficult with suitcases.","2342":"The apartment was clean, comfortable and in a good district. We very much enjoyed our stay, even with a few small inconveniences.","2343":"The check-in process is terrible. The office where you pick up your keys is more than a 20 minute walk from the apartment itself. This is not made clear and may require two taxis, one to the office and a second one to the apartment. Inside the apartment some of the cabinet faces were delaminated. The temperature inside the building is extremely hot, and there are minimal controls in the room. We had to open the doors and windows and keep the heat turned off to achieve a comfortable temperature when the outside temps ranged from 16 to 23 in late July.","2344":"Spacey rooms, 3 bathrooms, all kitchen amenities you need","2345":"Loud water \"pump\", the sheets had some dirty spots on them","2346":"Great location, close to food and transit.

It was just what we needed.","2347":"Very minor but the hot water and heat cut off after an hour of being turned on.","2348":"Great location, very cosy apartment and very good facilities. Ideal for a family or 2 couples.","2349":"Collecting the apartment key at a different location.

Also, because it is student accommodations there were very loud gatherings at all hours of the night. Not the properties fault! Just something to be aware of if you\u2019re a light sleeper","2368":"Very convenient and large room (apparentely a room for disabled persons). Quiet place. Convenient public transport facilities nearby (Luas tram, buses) ofering easy ways to get to downtown in Dublin city.","2369":"No possibility to simply make  tea or coffee in the room nor in the common kitchen. Which is useless when you are just travelling. We just came down from the plane in the evening and of course did not travel with breakfast stuff. Should be more convenient for people staying there a longer time.","2370":"Student accommodation in a convenient area \nwith en-suite bathroom. Considering the prices \nof Dublin accommodation this was good value. \nFriendly and helpful staff.","2371":"The room is in a shared flat so it\u2019s noisy \n(the doors bang and make a loud noise).

Very spacious with a private oasis out the back through the sliding glass doors.","2458":"The property had a lack of very basic items such as bin bags, washing up liquid, salt and pepper.","2459":"Bob was excellent great to deal with","2460":"Paid for outside space which wasn't provided. Check in was ok, however, preparation was poor as no towels. Facilities had to searched for and some were found in a cupboard stating it was the property of the owner. Cleanliness was average at best and there was no hot water throughout our stay. a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400 security deposit was taken which when you sum up the state of the place and the lack of facilities, seems very excessive.","2461":"","2462":"My friends and I stayed in this apartment in Dublin and we were pleasantly surprised!

They have no reception and therefore they send you nothing really helpful you tube videos of how to put the key out of the lockbox then walking to the apartment. No address where to find the belfaSt bike station!!! Even after several calls they only told us to watch the video. First the video didn\u2019t show you where the lockbox is, Second we couldn\u2019t watch it without WiFi!!! \nAfter a kind of treasure hunt was the lockbox empty, ten minutes before official check in and they told us we would be able to check in from two o clock!\nBefore heading with your car to the parking place, you have to enter the apartment to got the white card for parking garage entry! \nHeaded to the flat, Meeting the cleaner at three, have to wait until she finished until twenty past three, we couldn\u2019t find the parking card.

The location is great. Dublin itself was wonderful. And it was at the very least affordable, because everything else in Dublin was so f- expensive. The city itself is cheap, but the housing - good God.","2505":"It was COLD. And not only the room, everything in Ireland was so cold - the restaurants, the bars, the shops, everything. And I am not usually a 30-degrees-only person. The room itself was poorly isolated and the radiators made very little difference.

The equipment of the apartment was sufficient. It was tidy and clean.","2548":"The address of the apartment was not known until arrival. Office buildings nearby. The bedrooms were quite small, but sufficient for a short stay. We didn't have access to a garbage disposal.","2549":"spacious","2550":"mold in the bathroom    all the tile In both bathrooms needed a good scrubbing with bleach","2551":"The neiborhood is beautifull and quiet","2552":"The pickup key was far from the apartment","2553":"facilities were good. great showers, recliner leather sofas, kitchen, lifts. quite area(Parkhouse apartment).","2554":"balcony floor was not safe.","2555":"Good space \nComfy beds\nStaff at pick up office very good and accommodating","2556":"Location a bit far out of town for us. \nFloor was not clean. Needed a good wash rather than a hoover.\nNo instructions left for equipment.\nWas left a note to say someine had been in the appartment on our first day to fix something.

Good location","2558":"More kitchen utensils.Instructions for electrical equipment","2559":"Great location to have a walk around the city centre, there are plenty of pubs nearby. The house was absolutely impeccable and very comfy, with the Netflix subscription being the cherry on top of a wonderful cake!","2560":"Location was fantastic and car rental right opposite was a bonus. Apartment was well equipped.","2561":"Not dislikes but shower only goes to lukewarm and then cold so extremely quick showers had.\nTV was all in Spanish which we finally managed to change but everytime we turned the TV on we had to reset everything again and no channel's other than Netflix. If you haven't got an account then forget it.","2562":"Location was central and perfect to enjoy City Centre. Dublin Express for\/from the Airport is 10 minutes walking.","2563":"Noisy street by night. Especially Friday and Saturday.","2564":"Everything here needed, very clean, comfortable, easy access, great location, parking on street 7pm-7am or carpark over road, easy key pick up, very good price,","2565":"Only thing would be the bedroom window, bit of road noise, maybe new rubber window seals would help, but great place to stay, thank you","2566":"Location was OK\nSize of apartment was just right for 4 adults","2567":"That the apartment was on 3rd floor with no lift.\nWhen you let water out of kitchen sink it came up in shower tray\nThe sink in bathroom took at least 20 minutes to empty","2568":"Perfect location, equidistant between Croke Park and Temple Bar, right off O'Connell Street. Super easy to get keys, and host in great communication throughout to let us know when it was OK to check in, and what to do on check out. Bed very comfortable, and bedroom a good size. Sofa also comfy, and kitchen well appointed for the size of the flat. Good wifi that allowed us to stream a Netflix show in the evening (using our own Amazon stick which we had brought with us). Nice bathroom, with decent pressure in the shower.","2569":"The water system can be a bit noisy - best not flush the toilet at night (although the noise doesn't last long). The flat is far nicer than the communal stairway may indicate.","2570":"It was close to the city centre and around a 15 minute walk to the Croke park stadium where we were going to a concert.","2571":"It was on the 3rd floor so quite a lot of stairs and no lift.","2572":"A good location quite close to the central parts of Dublin. Bus to the ferryport passes the property. Good wifi. The apartment was quite spacious and was secure.","2573":"Complete lack of any instructions for using equipment such as the cooker, TV, shower. Collection of keys was a problem as the code was sent after I had started to make the journey to Dublin and I could not access the email sent to me. Details about the property state that upper floors are accessible only by stairs - it was not clear that the flat was on the third floor and necessitated climbing six flights of stairs.","2574":"The location is great to visit dublin. The rooms were pleasant and made up to feel good and safe.There was free coffee which was very much appreciated by us.","2575":"it was rather hard for us to find the correct house and furthermore to get the keys.The house number is doubled in the address: 24 24 Gresham House is given - but it's 24 Gresham House.That confused us a bit as we searched for 2424 at first - we are not the brightest obviously.The keys can be picked up at a different location - a sports bar. We did not know that and it was not shown in the booking App. However we managed to contact the host via Phone and WhatsApp and we finally got the information how to pick up the keys... pheeew... The free coffee in the apparment helped us to stop the headache that was coming on.","2576":"very nice location, comfortable with a good wifi and well decorated.\nwell located within a walking distance to the main attractions.\nsupermarket around the corner was convenient for breakfast.\nSixt rental car is just nearby which is also convenient.","2577":"Mike and Michael were amazing!

Next time I am back at Dublin, I will definitely stay at this property again!","2578":"Everything was perfect!","2579":"We loved it! Especially the personal approach! 2 Mikes are great!

We will definitely come back!","2580":"Michael and Mike are very kind and super hosts, they are very welcoming and happy to help. We had a great stay with Michael and Mike.

The breakfast is very good and in your room you have water, lemonade, tea, coffee , biscuits available.The rooms are charming and beautifully decorated and very clean.We know where to stay when going to Dublin!","2581":"All was perfect, nothing to mention here.","2582":"Mike & Michael\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home was the best place to stay to explore Dublin. The room was perfect- it had everything we needed and more including a snack selection and a complimentary bottle of fizz for new years, which was a lovely touch. \nThe Homestay is very well connected to the city centre and the airport via public transport and we were given very helpful instructions from the airport. \nThroughout our stay, Mike & Michael were generous with their time and recommendations of pubs, restaurants & Dublin attractions. We also loved meeting Buttons & Twix! \nThank you again for everything - our experience at your Homestay was a big part of why we had such a great time in Dublin!","2583":"N\/A","2584":"","2585":"Price for the room was respectable for the location. Friendly staff and a quick check in.","2586":"Check out is a bit early at 10.30am and checking in isn't possible before","2587":"The location is amazing. The staff is also nice.","2588":"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very old and needs a renovation. The bathroom was moldy. If you need something cheap in the city center this works","2589":"First experience in a hostel. excelente private bathroom and location if you are interested in the Temple Bar area. 6.5\/10 for confort and the fact that you need to place ur own bed lining. But the duvet was warm and room was always at the perfect temperature for a freezing weather outside. Summarizing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a hotel but worth what u pay for.","2590":"Maybe the cleanness\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not bad cause the sheets were smelling nice but there were hairs around the sheets or floors. Also keep in mind it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next to a club so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget earplugs for a better sleep.","2591":"Location, hospitality and friendliness at the reception, ready to help, nice kitchen, clean and cosy rooms, heating, the luggage room","2592":"","2593":"The rooms are really clean and the facilities are excellent.","2594":"There is no elevator. \nSo if you have lot of bags, you might have some trouble carrying the bags up.","2595":"The room was clean and tidy. The entrance instructions were very clear. It was only a 20 minute walk into the city centre.","2596":"There was no staff onsite so although they offered the facility to store luggage when we arrived, we couldn't because there was nobody to pay.","2597":"It was not very clean and during the night a green light so it was difficult to sleep with the light.","2598":"We liked the location, the noise does not disturb you from the outside.","2599":"The bathroom was not as clean as it could be. Be careful when leaving your food in common fridges. It can be stolen.","2600":"check in was very smooth. friendly lounge. excellent facilities. 10\/10","2601":"Location. Very tense. Enormously under the spell of...? \nHostel cleaners. rude. no manners. arrogant. boorish. very inexperienced. reluctant to be decent.  A lot of dirty looks. staring. abilty to be very very hostile. totally unwelcoming. arrogant. imperious. bad attitude. negative. judgemental.","2602":"Location was really good, closeby to public transport and the mail streets. Room was nice and clean, nice little own bathroom with okay shower.","2603":"There was a lot of noise and smells and warmth coming from the restaurant below us right in our room untill 3 at night. The entire room smelled like fastfood and was either really warm with the windows closed or really loud noises from the air ventilation from the restaurant with the windows open (also when closed it was loud)","2604":"Mattresses need to be changed","2605":"Decent value for 4 lads travelling to Dublin for one night.","2606":"Lock box access was open to abuse as people seemed to be milling around the property. Rooms were okay, but the shower didn't have any hot water","2607":"Had lockers and privacy curtains which were very much appreciated, excellent value for money.","2608":"Bathrooms were great, apart from a pretty poor shower but it's useable and is a minor point","2609":"Room was clean and building was easy to find. Check in and check out was very easy.","2610":"Beds were extremely uncomfortable.","2611":"Well equipped. Great location, in walking distance of what we needed. Very helpful staff.","2612":"Lovely, clean, good location for olympia theater attendance","2613":"Instructions for parking was poor due to one way street.  Put 80 augustine street into Google map its on the right hand side","2614":"amazing spacious apartment and well equipped! great staff on duty all the time!","2615":"the fold out bed in the lounge was extremely uncomfortable!and parking closer would have been better..","2616":"clean and spacious","2617":"nothing","2618":"The staff were amazing and always so helpful.","2619":"location\nfacilities","2620":"small. No room for luggage in bedrooms","2621":"Had a lovely weekend away with my sister and Mother visiting from France. The location was perfect to visit Dublin, plenty to do close by and most pubs\/\/restaurants nearby. Safe location.The apartment was cosy, clean and comfortable. Even the sofa bed was good quality.","2622":"comfortable room with excellent layout, including a full kitchen with oven, cookware, fridge and Nespresso machine.  Bed was acceptable as was the bathroom.","2623":"After 5 attempts to get the TV internet services active so I could stream Netflix, I gave up.  No one bothered to come to the room to resolve the issue.  Also, there's no phone to reception...so every incident requires a trip downstairs.  And don't expect a full balcony...basically doors to open for fresh air...not a big deal, but some truth in advertising would go a long way.  Lastly, there's no daily housekeeping.  I get that it's a self-contained unit.  However, when I'm paying the same daily rate for 7-nights, as someone that's just staying one night, and the housekeepers clean daily stays, it seems rather cheap.","2624":"Great location, 4 min walk to Vicar St. Pub next door and close to city centre","2625":"Balcony was small, otherwise place was perfect.","2626":"Shower ran out of hot water also insufficient hot water to shaveAs an improvement it would be helpful to add hooks or a hanging rail inside the cupboard in the hall. that way wet coats could be hung up","2627":"Bus station to the city centre was just outisde the accommodation. A little too far to walk on foot but the public transport is excellent and on point. Room was clean and also the kitchen for breakfast. Highly recommended for a good budget.","2628":"Great location, friendly helpful staff and the room had everything we needed for our stay.","2629":"Super cozy and clean quiet room i had a vey good night sleep","2630":"Although no noise reached my room, the guest house is on a trafficky street","2631":"it was noisy, since my room faced the street","2632":"Excellent service.","2633":"Nothing","2634":"The bus stops right outside going to towards city centre and the other way to the airport was ideal, which were only \u20ac5.20 for 2 people compared to the taxis which were overly expensive. Although 2 miles from city centre it is ideal as it has pubs and restaurants as well as Lidl and Tesco on the doorstep. Great location","2635":"Nothing really, it doesn't serve a hot breakfast, but we knew that prior to booking so not a problem.","2636":"clean room , central location","2637":"on a busy street","2638":"Small ,compact yet more than comfortable for us to stay and the  bus stop  nearby made our travel easy.\nOverall we loved our stay here.","2639":"I had a TV ,a comfortable bed, plenty of hot water and good heatingin the room.","2640":"Room was in the attic..Apex or triangular shaped.\nCould not lock the door in my room. Anyone could walk in anytime.","2641":"Clean and comfortable quiet ensuite bedroom. Use of the sitting room which had tea and coffee facilities. The B","2642":"the property was in a good access point to the river and not far from the main points of interest. there were some initial issues with the heating and hot water but the manager completely took care of it within 24 hours which I was very pleased about.","2643":"Outside noises were loud, people yelling and singing all throughout the night. the widows are just too thin to insulate noise and weather. also the door slamming downstairs was so loud to us as well (1st floor). maybe there can be something done to insulate the windows and to slow does the front door from slamming.","2644":"Beds were comfortable. Clean. Very warm. Relatively quiet. Excellent location.","2645":"Shower was a bit unpredictable. Had to learn about Irish immersion water heaters. An interesting concept. Bit confusing as to entering   apartment.","2646":"amazing location, very spacious and modern","2647":"there was a building site that started early in the morning so a tad noisy.","2648":"The location of this property is great, very near the Temple Bar area and the town centre itself, but still quiet enough. Apartment was warm, and clean.","2649":"The lighting in the apartment was bad, No mirror in the bedroom, Hairdryer was broken, No normal TV, No batteries in remote, shower head chest height-broken, 4 odd mugs in the cupboard, expectations on photos not met, need a bit of TLC and attention to detail.","2650":"Good location, short walk to most places, spacious, clean.","2651":"bed wasn\u2019t the best, can be rather noisy on the side street with late passer-by\u2019s.","2652":"location was great!","2653":"WiFi instructions in binder were wrong; had to figure out how to connect by looking at the router.","2654":"I liked that the location was very close to the center of the city and a short walk many tourist attractions and bars\/restaurants. Our host was also very responsive and accommodating, especially with allowing us to drop our luggage off early before check-in. The apartment was very clean and quite comfortable, and had everything we needed.","2655":"The \"look\" of the apartment was not the most stylish, and a couple small things (including the lock on the bathroom door) were broken. The street the apartment also seemed to be the go-to destination for drunk tourists\/locals to urinate on the walls, so the smell going in and out the front door wasn't great. The price was a bit more expensive than I think it ought to be, but then again, I booked late so can't complain too much about the places that were still available. The apartment served the purposes of me and my group and we still felt safe and comfortable in the space.","2656":"The apartment is inside the city center! The total room was OK and generally we had no problems during our accommodation.  Finally UT is very well equipped.","2657":"Very spacious, comfortable beds, extremely clean.","2658":"Occasionally smelled cigarette smoke from another unit that is occupied by full time tenants.","2659":"amazing location","2660":"confusion around how we got into property and how we locked up after","2661":"Great location, absolutely spotless and very modern. Everything you need in the apartment, very close to shops and pubs.","2662":"They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a life so you have to walk up a few flights of stairs with cases & bags etc but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let it put you off, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth it!","2663":"Clean linen and spare blankets , pillows and duvet if needed . Amazing location .central to everything abs our host gave tourist recommendations which we took up and thoroughly enjoyed . Check out was easy and great communication with host during our stay . Excellent would recommend Celtic nights abs the vintage tea on the bus - marvelous","2664":"We could not access live tv but that could have been our inability to work the controls . We could not find a plug so washed our dishes in the large saucepan . We could have contacted host about these issues but for us they did not really impair the quality of our stay . We just made do with a smile \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0192","2665":"Very nice, clean and aromatic apartment in a good location.\nThe windows are beautiful and big sash windows","2666":"As this is a multiple apartment block. Some people keep leaving the front door unlocked which is a bit of a concern when you are not in the apartment.\nThe local area is a little run down.\nThe sash window in the bedroom is single glazed and let's a lot of noise in which is disruptive to sleep. Probably would make the apartment very cold in the winter as the windows in the living room are also single glazed.","2667":"Great central location just off O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Connell street with the airport bus stop just over the road. Friendly staff with good facilities.","2668":"Bedrooms could have been cleaner as dust on sides and floors.","2669":"The location was fantastic, perfect for us to get to the arena and to temple bar. Easy access to shops to pick up breakfast and essentials for our trip. It was also really quiet as well which helped for a good night's sleep after an evening singing our hearts out in several lovely pubs.","2670":"The TV didn't have live channels but it didn't matter because that just meant we had to go watch the rugby in a pub with a Guinness, what a shame! The shower was also a bit odd and the water came out in bursts rather than a steady flow but it was nothing unmanageable.","2671":"great position, close to the city centre\nlots of room","2672":"not so clean","2673":"Spacious accommodation","2674":"Not the nicest part of town","2675":"extrem Gute Lage : nicht einmal 10min zu Fu\u00c3\u0178 von Trinitiy College, Temple Bar...... 5 min zu O Connolly Street...mit dem Bus 20min zu Howth.

Only 10 minutes walk to the centre. The staff was lovely and the gave us the room before the check in which we really appreciated because we had chance to leave our things in the room. The room was quiet and any noise at night. The kitchen has everything you need to cook and honestly the place is worthy 100%.","2688":"The only can say was about the size of the bed but we sleep very good anyway.","2689":"close to tram and city","2690":"The location is fine, beds are correct for a few nights.","2691":"The staff wasn't polite, didn't even say hello. They don't care about you basically. Plus the doors are noisy, the walls not soundproofing, bathroom not cleverly designed. It's not welcoming as you can imagine.","2692":"Value for money. En suite room with plenty of sockets. One towel provided per person. Kitchen equipped with utensils and basic appliances (fridge, microwave, kettle). Only one chair inside the room. Very close to tram station and bus stop.","2693":"Hairdryer only available on request and we can only have it for when we are using it (borrow it from reception and return immediately after, which is a little inconvenient). Toilet and bathroom is combined, so like other reviewers said they do get wet, I agree that they should at least provide a floor mat for when we step out of the bathroom. Bed is definitely smaller than a double, so be prepared for a squeeze if you're average sized.","2694":"The location was good due to the Luas being very close. Friendliness of staff","2695":"The accommodation was very tired and needed attention. Artistic license had been used for the marketing photos, it was a room with bare walls, a bed and wardrobe with no coat hangers. The common area of lounge and kitchen, although surface clean was looking very secondhand. The sofas were worn and missing the vinyl  covering making their cleanliness questionable, very reluctant to use them.  When opening the oven door the glass was detached, so unable to use the oven.  No means of washing up, ie liquid or tea towel, if spending a few days in Dublin you don\u2019t expect to have to take this with you.  The smoke detector was constantly bleeping even though this was reported to housekeeping\/reception no action was taken.","2696":"Decent location, simple check in, comfortable bed, access to kitchen.","2697":"Only one roll of toilet paper, no shampoo or soap. No bathroom floor rug, so water got everywhere.","2698":"The facilities were very good,kitchen and common places were very usefull.","2699":"I didn't like the bathroom,it was very small and poor.","2700":"Having a kitchen and lounge","2701":"With the necessary window open, very noisy","2702":"No breakfast, the room was clearly unclean, with only a bedding change in site. It had multiple different hair types, clearly visible on entrance to Bathroom\/Room\/Bed\/Kitchen\/Lounge.Our room after spending all day out of it, we came to find, didn\u2019t lock! Somebody came tightened a screw, it locked but within our next 2 hours it was broken again! My girlfriend of 2 years, (our anniversary trip) felt uneasy to sleep in an unlocked room, even with myself on the door side and having wedged, under the door gap with my own clothes, for her to be able to rest on our last night! We feel a response and a refund is valid.","2703":"Cleanliness, Security, Info,","2704":"The lifts worked well.","2705":"The room was stiflingly hot. There was no soap in the bathroom and it was impossible to have a decent shower without the toilet getting soaked as the screen was inadequate.","2706":"every apartment is super comfortable the bed is wonderful!  perfect location!  the building condo very clean and beautiful!  great area!

The ceilings are dirty, cracks in the walls, well worn bed sheets, a shower that could only be turned on by turning on the sink. The TV set up.is also precarious to say the least. The place is not to an acceptable standard for the associated price","2711":"Ein sehr sch\u00f6nes Appartment, sehr gute Lage und ruhige Umgebung.

Didn\u2019t like the fact people having access from restaurants below when going to the ladies toilet could go up the stairs to all the appointments, one night when we where in our apartment someone came all the way up to our top floor apartment and tried the door then tried all the doors going back down. Needs a key coded door between stairs to the apartments and ladies toilet landing.  Thermostat didn\u2019t work so no hot radiator \/ towel rail to dry towels. Luckily got heat fro aircon in main bedroom.","2780":"The sheets on one side of the bed were stained","2781":"stylish, comfortable and clean","2782":"no information on wifi (I think there was supposed to be a booklet of info sheet, but we couldn\u2019t find one)","2783":"I was a bit surprised as this is more of an Airbnb than a hotel. No front desk, elevator or room key. We had to ask the staff at the neighboring restaurant for information on how to access the room. Once we were in the room it was fine. I will say that I would stay here again knowing what I know.","2784":"The main door to the building was heavy and didn\u2019t lock, even though there was a key pad.","2785":"great location, right in the heart of Dublin.","2786":"rooms are apartment style with no lobby or staff onsite. \nvery loud. you can hear every door open\/close in \nthe hallway as well as people speaking. there is a \nbar directly downstairs which tends to be noisy late.","2787":"Location and very smart","2788":"Needs a chair in the room to call it a suite\nThe electronic lock expecially the front door needs to be improved.

I then had a lot of difficulties contacting someone to sort this, I sent several emails to the Clarendon Suites and Booking.com with no response. The phone number I was given wasn\u2019t answered and there was no facility to leave a message. I finally got an answer on the phone just before I travelled.  .

Pero la gesti\u00f3n es nefasta. A nuestra llegada todav\u00eda segu\u00edan limpiando de los inquilinos anteriores, no pasa nada, pero no es agradable llegar con ganas de descansar y que haya personas trabajando en el piso. Lo peor de todo fue que ofrec\u00edan sitio para aparcar gratuitamente dentro de la urbanizaci\u00f3n, pero a mi llegada nadie sab\u00eda nada. Hab\u00eda carteles de \u201cprohibido aparcar salvo autorizaci\u00f3n\u201d por todos lados, pero nadie en la gesti\u00f3n del alquiler me supo decir si estaba autorizado. Despu\u00e9s de varias llamadas y mails, me dijeron que ten\u00eda que pagar seg\u00fan indicaban en los carteles, pero los carteles no dec\u00edan nada. Otro me dijo que ya estaba resuelto, pero al d\u00eda siguiente me escribi\u00f3 otro para decirme que \u201ccre\u00eda\u201d que ten\u00eda que pagar un euro al d\u00eda. Pero no sab\u00eda c\u00f3mo. Fue algo desesperante hasta que finalmente al tercer d\u00eda me dijeron que ya estaba autorizado.\nEl piso tiene de todo, pero mal aprovechado. Hay un lavavajillas grande, pero 5 tenedores, cubiertos, platos,\u2026 lo que te obliga a fregar a mano o poner el lavavajillas medio vac\u00edo. Hay un horno estupendo, pero cada vez que lo utilizas, salta la alarma de incendios y no hay instrucciones para apagarla. Hay wifi, pero la conexi\u00f3n es mal\u00edsima. Imposible utilizar ese internet para trabajar, ha sido desesperante.\nComentar que un d\u00eda apareci\u00f3 sin avisar un t\u00e9cnico diciendo que ten\u00eda que revisar el cuadro de luces. A mi no me hab\u00eda avisado nadie por lo que no le dej\u00e9 entrar en la casa. Le dio igual porque el cuadro de luces estaba en la calle. Sin decirnos nada cort\u00f3 la luz y nos dej\u00f3 sin luz y sin agua mientras nos duch\u00e1bamos. Sin preguntar y sin que nadie me hubiera avisado.\nPero la guinda del pastel ha sido la lavadora. Cuando llegamos nos dijo la persona que estaba limpiando el piso que perd\u00eda agua y no se pod\u00eda utilizar.

I had certain expectations given the location of the property but this was a terrible experience and I did not feel at ease given the other tenants in the property. \u20ac100 per night is not justified for this room.","2905":"The space was very clean.","2906":"It is just not worth the price at all.","2907":"The Front door could be open to the left hand side and we had a wrong Instruction for front door","2908":"unfortunately we've been in lots of Noises comming from Around!I had my Kid with me and those Loud drunk noises was disturbing specially on Sunday night Which they started  from  Saturday evening to exact  Sunday morning...The rest was good.

Staff are cheery and eager to help.","2928":"This place is in desperate need of some TLC. Our room (307) was on the top floor, the stairs are incredibly creaky and warped to the point that we felt like we were going up\/down sideways. The room itself had a bad smell which we couldn\u2019t place and actually remained on our clothes. The carpet had wet patches (Probably from previous occupants) which had not dried by the time we left (We stayed for 3 nights).\nThe rooms look nothing like the photos, besides the general shape. The beds are comfortable, but there was no table or chair within the room itself besides a stool which had the kettle with cups, tea, coffee, etc. Very confused about the TV placement which was in the opposite corner from the bed and on a fixed wall mount, so couldn\u2019t turn it to even see the screen.\nOverall, for \u20ac100+ a night, this felt like staying in a hostel with a wall between residents. Would much rather pay an extra \u20ac20 per night for a significant upgrade elsewhere in the city.","2929":"The staff is very polite and attentive.\nThe comfort of the bed and pillows.\nThe bathroom is great.","2930":"The cleanliness was horrible.\nI found intimate vibrator, cigarette, dirt, water heater.\nThe bar on the first floor is very noisy and compromises the silence on the second floor. This is already warned in the hotel's ad in the hotel booking.","2931":"location in relation to Temple Bar","2932":"disturbance from nightclub sound","2933":"s\u00faper limpio y c\u00f3modo! buena ubicaci\u00f3n , un barrio hermoso y a 15 min del centro en tren","2934":"","2935":"Such a great location away from the noise of the absolute centre but still a scenic walk to the heart of everything.

I did not received refund even after requesting multiple times.","2955":"+ the location was easily accessible via public transportation (dart)+ quiet neighborhood+ grocery store was only about ~10 Minute walk away+ quick reply to questions via whatsapp (with a grain of salt, see the negative section for the response time for resolving issues!)+ Heater in the bathroom.","2956":"GENERAL:\n- We had to clean through the entire apartment before setting down our things, since there was a lot of dust, dirt and also leftover hair from the previous people.\n- When an issue arose (subsequent they will be listed with a *), the resolution time was always quite long, since \"the property manager\" wasn't there. Even when it came to emergencies (water, electricity, see below).\n- *While we were staying there, there was a water outage in the area. Sandymount studios is not able to rectify municipal issues, but when writing with them throughout the day (water outage was ~24h), they were not very helpful in finding a resolution\/solution, even if temporarily (e.g. water canisters for cooking \/\"flushing\" \/ washing).\n- *During our stay, the electricity \"stopped working\" twice. We found out, that this was due to the fact that they need to \"top off\" the meter for the apartment. They didn't tell us anything about this upfront and it seemed that they were not prepared for our 2.5 week visit, at all.\nBATHROOM:\n- When arriving, we didn't have any towels.\n- The shower had mold in the corners.\n- *The toilet seat was \"hanging by a thread\".  Even after letting them know, nothing was done about this.\n- *The toilet flush took ages (10-15 Minutes) to refill the reservoir. Also this was mentioned and was not fixed during our stay.\n- *No soap upon arrival (meaning that after a long trip and travel from the airport, we were not able to wash our hands properly).\nBEDROOM:\n- Due to the amount of dust, I had a lot of trouble breathing when spending more time in the apartment.\n- The mattresses were worn out.\n- Also in the bedroom we needed to clean everything (hair, dust, dirt).\n- *only 2 Hangers were available in the closet.\nKITCHEN:\n- Kitchenutensils\/plates\/bowels missing\/not available.\n- *BAKING TRAY was not available (Nothing to put something into the oven).","2957":"Comfortable ,cosy and private .

Lack of facilities such a extractor fun not working. I mentioned it a few times but nobody came to get it done un the kitchen.  For what it cost the quality isn't great.

Very cold.","2992":"location","2993":"switched off heating. was lucky to find an oil heater","2994":"very good location for north inner city Dublin. You can walk to O\u2019Connell St. and the GPO. The house itself is very big, big rooms and plenty of furniture and nice hot shower, fully equipped kitchen. It\u2019s pretty cool. Interesting and diverse co-inhabitants.","2995":"There\u2019s only one shower room for the whole house (6 rooms!) and you had to wait practically every time to use the shower room. The furniture, deco etc is okay but a bit dated and look used. No staff onsite, so you if your phone is dead etc you can\u2019t get hold of anyone but yeah, so you need to be pretty self sufficient.","2996":"The location was great. Right on the bus line. The room was secure and mostly quiet. The bed was comfortable but a little lumpy. I was pretty much left alone. There was a lot of information available I lable about how to get around Dublin and what sights to see. It is located in a neighborhood that boasted all the amenities one could want including some wonderful restaurants and pubs. It was quiet.","2997":"Not crazy about the shower off the kitchen downstairs. I never knew when to go down there or how long I'd have to wait if it was occupied. B&b is a little misleading. The second b is kitchen privileges. Buy it and cook it yourself if you can. This was essentially a student rooming house. The upstairs toilet would not accept toilet paper. Instead of flushing it down, one had to deposit it in a bin next to it. Kind of strange. They need to fix the plumbing.\nI never saw the manager. \"Check in\/Check out is a bit of a misnomer. It's more like \"show up\/leave.\"\u00b9","2998":"venue","2999":"difficult to find","3000":"Full kitchen shared with other guests","3001":"Difficulty booking as price kept changing as i was in the process of booking","3002":"There was plenty of shops, restaurants nearby.\nStaff have been helpful by phone.","3003":"The dirt. We stayed without toilet paper for days. We had to ask for some. The toilet garbage has been full for few days.

Also the heating does not work. It was terribly cold, it was impossible to be without a coat. Warm water is a rarity, it is only in the shower. Washing hands, washing or washing dishes with warm water is unrealistic. When we turned to the owner of the house to solve the problem with heating, he ignored numerous requests, not only ours, but also all the guests. Also, only one of the two toilets worked, the second was completely clogged and stank terribly. I do not recommend.","3008":"Location: city center, with lots of shops nearby\nClean and well kept. \nKitchen and cooking facilities available.\nLiving room and dining area available. \nHighly recommended for families.","3009":"A bit inconvenient if you have large baggage, to go up the stairs.","3010":"Location was excellent.  Facilities within the accommodation were good, property was clean.","3011":"modern reburbishment, comfortable beds, central location","3012":"low water pressure in showers","3013":"Spotless clean spacious and warm appartment at the very heart of temple bar area, just 50 meters from the iconic temple bar. Though  our flight was delayed for 2 hours after their working hours,Adrianne was waiting to check us in with a smile.  A full case of a big Nespresso selection,as well as tea etc were at our disposal. Searched for long for a fair accomodation price at the Temple bar (which I wouldn't choose again for our stay as we are not the kind of travelers who party after a long day out) I think I nailed it.","3014":"The double beds were kind of small for two people and yes,the bedrooms which are located at the back of the appartment facing a street were apparently people go to argue or fight at night could use some better sealing. We would also like to have some towel hangers at the bathrooms. Tip : Do not stop the running water as you shower ! It runs burning hot for quite \na while when you'll want to wash off.","3015":"Central location in the heart of temple bar area.Clean tidy and spacious with outdoor space. Easy access and exchange of keys and host very helpful.","3016":"Only downside of being central was it could get noisy at night but would not put me off staying there again.","3017":"clean and convenient for seeing the city","3018":"street noise (to be expected in Temple Bar) and homeless congregating in doorways of adjacent buildings after hours\u2026 didn\u2019t cause any issues.","3019":"central location. Great for two couples with two bathrooms. we loved having the outdoor space.","3020":"We loved the property and would definitely use it again. The only improvements that we would recommend would be a shaving point and a microwave.","3021":"Great little apartment in the heart of Temple Bar. Clean, comfy facilities. Nice big living room and we loved the little terrace to sit outside. One this I will say is the water pressure is pretty low, it\u2019s painful to wash your hands, or do the dishes or shower. If you are a light sleeper this place may not be for you, there\u2019s a fare amount of noise in the street outside the bedrooms at night and early hours however that didn\u2019t bother us at all Thanks for a great stay","3022":"Great location in the heart of Temple Bar. Host was always quick to respond and made sure to check in to make sure everything was going great with our stay. Thank you Debora! Also, Apartment was cleaned during our stay and was spotless after. Thank you again for an amazing stay at your property.","3023":"Perfect location! We arrived early and couldn\u2019t check in until 5pm but the office aloud us to leave our cases and go back for them at check In.","3024":"Very very noisy. The apartment needs to update to double glazing or something because if it\u2019s not people coming out of bars it\u2019s the constant road sweepers and just as that calms down its seagulls","3025":"The staff is so smiling, friendly, kind, helpful! Thank you! :) Regards: Margarita!","3026":"Good location, nice staff, nice common area with comfy couches","3027":"Short beds. Not good for tall people. Normally its ok because you can just stick your legs off the end, but here the beds are surrounded by a  railing that you cant stick your feet under. Mattress quality was ok, but pillows way too soft to sleep on the side. Also there are usb connections on the bed but they barely worked on my bed. Only if you pushed it, but when you release it, it doesnt work anymore. Overall decent hostel but for the money they can put a little more effort into improving some things. Especially for the money that they charge in high season for a hostel bed, they should really invest a bit more. I'd only come here in the low season.","3028":"Bed was comfortable, great location, lockers in reception were ideal to store bags","3029":"very central location & fair rates","3030":"Common area is bit crowded","3031":"GREAT hostel! Right by the second stop from the Dublin express and you are immediately in the Temple Bar area. The hostel is quiet and clean and there is staff 24\/7 in case you need anything. Perfect for solo female travellers! Also great location if you plan on doing bus tours throughout Ireland as most bus pick up locations are within a 10 minutes walk. I would definitely stay here again.","3032":"The only downside I could think of is that there was no real place to put my clothes in the shower. But that didn't bother me personally","3033":"Been there four or five times before and return for the professional, helpful experience.","3034":"Mabey like to see more smaller dorms. Prefer a quiet visit.","3035":"","3036":"Very good location. House was warm.","3037":"Smell of sewage throughout house, especially bedrooms, made for an unpleasant stay. Had to keep windows open to reduce pong. When we arrived cleaners were still working so we learned that the freezer was not working properly, solid block of ice, had been reported but no action taken. They were kind enough to defrost it. A toilet upstairs was unusable and had been reported multiple times, again not fixed. On the third day, after multiple contacts with the management company, this toilet was fixed, until then everyone walked through our room to use toilet in the bathroom with broken shower. The plumber confirmed the issue was lack of a trap in the shower to prevent gases escaping back into the building. See pictures. The house needs a deep clean, but is overall clean enough. Sitting room furniture very basic and kitchen furniture is very cheap, kitchen chairs coming apart and screws seem stripped as we couldn\u2019t tighten them. Could be a really nice place with a little tlc., feels like a neglected rental. Booking.com were pleasant but unable to broker any settlement with the management company. I\u2019m not looking to make out but some compensation would have left us feeling less abused by the circumstances. We breathed sewage gas for 10 days. Yuck.","3038":"the location was excellent and house was spacious. \nbedrooms were clean and beds very comfortable .\nplenty of hot water and house nice and warm. ample parking.","3039":"on arrival the kitchen was dirty. crumbs on surfaces on table and in sink. Crumbs on floor and skirting boards dirty. micro wave covered in old cooked on food. spent 2 hours cleaning!!. \nA lovely property that would benefit from some TLC and simple cosmetic repairs. freezer door broken, did not close. several other handle broken and cupboard doors hanging badly, dining chair broken and broken headrest in bathroom. unable to locate iron and ironing board. \nnot enough crockery, cutlery and kitchen equipment for 7 people. \nbottom stair carpet loose.","3040":"clean, location","3041":"difficult to reach the staff or in-charge person to explain how things works, switching on\/off heating system \u2026. etc\n+ complicated key delivery \n+ lack of communication to clarify the logistics","3042":"clean, well furnished","3043":"communication with help desk was not good enough\nconfusions with some technicalities \nno brochures on how to switch on certain stuff","3044":"the pullout couch was in good working condition","3045":"the plug in the bathroom sink didn\u2019t work and got stuck inside the sink so we couldn\u2019t use the sink. There is no hot water in the kitchen, like none, so we had to boil the kettle just to wash dishes. The oven is dirty, really grimy, and as soon as we switched on the oven it started to create a lot of smoke in the house. \nWe received an email with directions on how to enter the property when we arrived. The email gave the code for s lock box. there are two lock boxes, one with keys for the main house, and one with keys for the apartment. We had booked the apartment. I followed the directions in the email and used the code they had sent. It unlocked the keys for the main house. I  Had tried to unlock the apartment, but the keys didn\u2019t work. So I went to the main house and tried the keys, and it unlocked the door. My mom and I went inside the main house but quickly saw that it hadn\u2019t been serviced as there were alcohol cans all over the house, the beds weren\u2019t made, and there were used towels on the floor. \nI phoned the number in the email and a person answered. I explained who I am and that it doesn\u2019t seem like the house has been serviced since the previous guests checked out. The man was so rude and sarcastic! He asked really really sarcastically if I had booked the house or the apartment. I told him I had booked the apartment, and he was like okay! Like somehow I was the idiot. He then told me \u2018they\u2019 had probably emailed me the wrong access code, whoever they are. And gave me the code for the other lock code. The next morning I get an email saying please email them if I need anything. When I replied to the email to mention the cold water in the kitchen and the broken bathroom sink I got a reply that said that inbox is not monitored and I shouldn\u2019t send emails to it. It was very frustrating being in a foreign country and dealing with this unprofessionalism and absolutely poor service. They didn\u2019t care.","3046":"Good location.

However we saw a lot of business people putting their cases in the car and heading off for the day leaving the car in the car park! It was frustrating as if they have checked out, a time-limit should exist in the car park to allow other guests in.","3080":"Wonderful staff! Very accommodating to unforeseen situations, and took care of us very well. The location is also great, in a nice and safe area just a short walk to the city center.

The house was great, lovely furnishings and everything worked.  Location is good for coast and central Dublin we used the Dart ( short walk) everyday to get into Dublin and we used Ubers to get home (about 18 - 20 euro).","3098":"Can't think of anything at all.

Rooms are spotless clean and quite spacious, we were captivated by the high ceilings. We found the staff very helpfull and friendly. There was not even an issue with our early check in and they also didn\u2019t have a problem to book us a taxi early in the morning. We really enjoyed the breakfast in cozy and very stylish drawing room where you can find tea and coffee even during the whole day. This wasn\u2019t our first stay in Dublin, but definitely one of the best accommodations that we had.","3118":"Absolutely brilliant stay from start to finish. The man at reception was sooo welcoming and helpful.","3119":"","3120":"The room was cute, pretty decorated.\nThe best breakfast!\nThey let us store our luggage in the pub after we checked out.","3121":"Small bed.","3122":"location was fab and the rooms were lovely.

The room and the entire building were very clean and cozy.","3132":"The room was quite small, but OK overall.","3133":"We didn't get breakfast unfortunately as we left too early to be there, but also the Kitchen was being upgraded, but we got money off our booking for that, so it suited us great. The main Bar is warm, inviting and is well stocked, also reasonable prices. The bar man was fabulous. We really were weary travellers, and my 76 yr old Godmother was ready for the pot of tea that he brought us whilst checking in. Absolute Legend of a bloke! The beds were super comfy, the shower was incredible in terms of heat and pressure, and the linen was lush. Complimentary bottle of Guinness was outstanding. My friends agreed.","3134":"The only thing I'll mention, is that there was UHT milk pots for the tea and coffee making facilities, and I'd have preferred real milk. (Because I'm fussy!) Oh, and the mini fridge in your room needs to be plugged in by you if you want to use it, but otherwise is saving money on Electric, which is a plus for everyone!","3135":"The staff were class, Paul checked me in and he was very friendly, welcoming, generally a nice guy! The rooms are very cool too, old style beds, and a nice bottle of Guinness comes with the room which went down very well!","3136":"The main reason I booked the hotel was for the breakfast, as last time I stayed the breakfast was phenomenal however their kitchens were closed for renovations. An email was sent out however I never received it, so I was a bit disappointed about that, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the fault of the hotel.The only thing about the rooms was their pillows are pretty hard and I found it hard to get comfortable - but everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferences are different!","3137":"so nice cosy well decorated rooms, really something special, good location, very helpful nice staff and a really good breakfast","3138":"nothing to complain, everything was fine, we enjoyed our stay so much","3139":"The room was just right, the bed was comfy. We had a small fridge. The bathroom had a bathtub with jets. To the city center it's about 25 minutes and to the Convention Centre Dublin about 20 minutes by foot. There was a possibility to take a continental breakfast at the hotel for a reasonable price.","3140":"Everything was good. Although the bathroom door squeaked a bit.","3141":"Nice staff, clean","3142":"Vary nice room. Staff was friendly and helpful. The common space was beautiful. Location was good, we mostly walk all the time however there is a bus stop right at the entrance to the property.","3143":"N\/A - everything was great","3144":"Bed was comfy and massive!Located in a quite part of the city, but easily accessible by bus\/taxi\/walkStaff were friendly and very accommodating","3145":"Water ran brown in the bath as not used for a while.","3146":"Enjoyed my second stay here just as I did the first one.

If travelling to and from the airport the Aircoach bus stop is directly outside the front door. Great stay, would definitely stay again.","3205":"great location, spotless and comfortable beds.","3206":"the glass in the bathroom doors is a little odd","3207":"I spent here for a week with my families and It was an excellent over all service.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room has all u need if u wish to cook your own meals. Even tho it's a bit far from the city center, the apartment is in front of a bus stop and there is a luas (tram) station close by so it's easy to go around, there is also a Tesco express and spar walking distance. The room is fresh during cold weather and there are heaters in case it get too cold. It really exceeded our expectations :)","3210":"The automatic curtains are a bit tricky to use, we could not manage to level them and adjust them independently, maybe our fault we could not figure out. Anyway was not a big issue at all.","3211":"beautifully organised, lovely settings and great ambiance","3212":"the bed. it had wheels and the bed was moving all the time when we move on the bed. the bed had no breaks on the wheels.","3213":"Location was great for my work. The apartment or studio was very good. Free coffee, cooking appliances if needed and water In the fridge.","3214":"Thought the deposit was a lot for what you where getting..200 euro was excessive.. the TV wouldn't be that value.","3215":"Amazing room, equipped with all the things you would need from coffee machine to pots and pans for cooking. The suite was nice and clean, had a good size bed, comfortable mattress and good size TV. The shower room was nice and clean too. We were asked to pay a 200 euro deposit at the reception when we got our keys, this deposit was returned to me.","3216":"The heating in the suite wasn't great, although we turned the heaters on, it did not feel work enough in the room. The shower room doesn't have any storage compartments for toiletries. The lady at reception told us we would have our bedsheets and towels changed after 1 week (as we spent 10 days ) but this did not happen. Luckily, there was a laundry room on level one and I could wash them myself. I did not like the fact that the people staying above us were very noisy during the night (22pm-6am), 3 or 4 nights in a row ,by moving furniture,listening to loud music, fighting, which is forbidden and, no one was available at the reception for a complaint to be made, there and then when this happened. When I called the number listen on my email, I was asked to power through the night and speak with someone at reception the next day.\nOverall it was a nice experience and I would go back again.","3217":"Very large rooms, comfy and clean. I wasn\u2019t in the lovely one you see on the pictures more like the lowest end Suite they have but even that was very nice. \nI wasn\u2019t sure I was in a good area as it was a first time visit but the place called Rascals behind was great for pizza and a drink, they even make their own Beer! Plus you get 10% off when staying in the Suites. There were also local stores for food and drink as well as a few restaurants and pubs.","3218":"Bit expensive for the lower end suite I was in, it would be good to see the specific room before hand. \nNo easy parking here but I believe you can arrange it at a cost.\nThe only dirt was the window high on the wall (the only window in my room), looked like it hadn\u2019t been cleaned for a very long time so I pulled the blind down so that I wouldn\u2019t see it but it needs to be cleaned. I think it must get forgotten or too high for the cleaner to clean.","3219":"Excellent service and excellent staff well Done to all","3220":"At home","3221":"location, price and size of apartments","3222":"Room was spacious and clean and well equipped.","3223":"It is far from the centre, but easily accessible by bus or tram.","3224":"location, clean and nicely decorated","3225":"unable to shower due to water maintainable issue and was coming out brow","3226":"V. pleasant stay in Inchicore  suites.

Fantastic location only issue was the shower very difficult to get the right temperature either boiling or freezing..","3233":"The property was nice and in a great location, however it is advertised as non smoking but the place was smelling strongly of smoke throughout to the point that we could not sit in the living room area without our clothes smelling and making us feel nauseous.","3234":"We highlighted the issue to the company by email and spoke with a representative but nothing was done about it.","3235":"Nice place. It was clean and had a full kitchen","3236":"This is not an inn as the name suggests. This is just an apartment.

We were met by a representative a little early as requested due to bad weather but the apartment hadn\u2019t been cleaned when we were let in. It was actual a mess and the rep shrugged his shoulders and stated that he was doing us a favour. Not much of a favour and certainly not professional... we asked how to use the heating, that seemed to be an issue as he was obviously in a hurry ... we left and had to walk around the area trying to avoid the storm until the apartment was ready. It was not that massive an issue but the reps attitude was appalling. This continued on check out when he wouldn\u2019t come to pick up the keys or inspect the apartment. Again not very professional. We also could not get through to our point of contact who stated that we could only lease via what\u2019sapp which was a bit disappointing. On the apartment it is nice but a bit run down so while luxury doesn\u2019t quite equate it is pleasant. Just to reiterate the big problem here is the management of the property, just didn\u2019t care","3243":"Esta situado en una zona muy tranquila, con edificios modernos y variedad de restaurantes.\nAl centro de Dublin llegas andando en 20 minutos.

Il WiFi \u00e8 perfettamente funzionante. \nAbbiamo trovato il phon e degli asciugamani.","3297":"","3298":"Mancava la carta igienica, ma abbiamo provveduto noi...\nLa posizione non \u00e8 delle migliori se rimani per pochi giorni: le linee di autobus che portano verso il centro sono a 7-8 minuti di cammino, e pu\u00f2 essere scomodo se si ha poco tempo e un bambino piccolo (come nel nostro caso), ma per un soggiorno pi\u00f9 lungo in una zona tranquilla (e anche graziosa) pu\u00f2 essere un buon posto.","3299":"","3300":"La calefacci\u00f3n,  el piso estaba caliente","3301":"","3302":"La limpieza dej\u00f3 un poco que desear.\nCacerolas con pasta pegada, poco menaje,","3303":"","3304":"There are no comments available for this review","3305":"Spacious, very close facilities, cosy, was great money for the quality of the stay","3306":"Clean.

Impossible to have a conversation and choice of music aeful","3322":"plan and simple","3323":"not value for the money","3324":"Lovely staff. Very nice room. Superb shower. Had everything you could think of. Very good value.","3325":"Tiny thing.

We only went once and there were mostly men who kept staring at us and that made us feel uncomfortable. It was also quite busy.","3331":"The staff were super attentive and friendly","3332":"Good services and hosts. Hotel is well located !","3333":"Breakfast is not included and need additionnal fees.","3334":"Large rooms by European standards. Kind size bed was very comfortable and nice balcony area. Lots of construction going on in the area so quite noisy early in the morning but that will obviously be a short-term issue. Nice touches such as slippers and gowns available and lovely bar area in the hotel. Close to trams so easy to get around.","3335":"Corridor areas are quite tired and could do with new carpeting and a refresh. Only one elevator was working so took some time to get up\/down when the hotel was busy.","3336":"It was exactly what we were looking and expecting for. The room was clean and the beds were confortable. Great stay. Thanks again.","3337":"a very nice and comfy room..the owner and the daughter is very accommodating.. location is good .","3338":"Julie was very friendly, welcoming, and helpful. She is a great host and I'm happy I got to meet her.","3339":"Nothing","3340":"A clean and bright small house. All the utilities worked well. Furniture was minimal, but looked new. Location was excellent for us, as it is close to relatives. For any family staying, the property is in a small, tidy development that seems well-established and secure. It was great to have parking, though don\u2019t bring a wider car! Shay was good at communicating through email","3341":"I\u2019d suggest a few more \u201chome-like\u201d touches, as the walls are mostly bare. The one book that was there was great, btw! The appliances in the kitchen looked great, but a couple of instruction sheets might help - we couldn\u2019t get the moka coffee maker to work on the induction stove top. First world problems, I suppose!","3342":"Hot water service not operating. However, host was very helpful and sorted out the problem quickly","3343":"The house was conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood. We drove from the airport to the property in a rental car and used the bus to go to and from the city centre (3 day Leap Visitor Card). The bus stop was an 8 minute walk from the house and there was a convenience store\/ fuel station located between the house and the bus stop. Using the bus saved us from driving to and parking in the city center. We could buy pretty much everything we needed at the store. The house is a perfect location for those who want a place to land after the city centre scene.","3344":"The house is a work in progress. It is clean and has two bedrooms with a bathroom. The house is missing some of the homey touches - lamp shades, art work, curtains, bathroom towel hooks, and ventilator fans.... The beds are most suitable for a close couple or small children. It is not possible to sleep on the sofa.","3345":"The location was nice a quiet, taxi was a bit expensive to get to city center and back but the cost of staying in the city center was also prohibitive.  Well kept property and at the end of a cul-de-sac.","3346":"The beds were very uncomfortable, new mattresses or at least a good mattress pad would have helped.  The bedsprings were very noticeable.  Instructions on using the stovetop, the washer and the shower would have been very helpful.  I binder is always nice to refer to when you are staying in a private property.","3347":"modern clean great for a long weekend","3348":"Good checkout time","3349":"didn\u2019t have a hot tub :\/","3350":"Endroit tr\u00e8s calme proche d\u2019une ligne de bus amenant directement \u00e0 Dublin.","3351":"","3352":"on vit dans un quartier r\u00e9sidentiel entour\u00e9 d\u2019irlandais dans une maison typique","3353":"","3354":"la maison est bricol\u00e9e.

Havia um barulho de \u00e1gua constante, provavelmente vindo do sistema de \u00e1gua quente.  A casa precisa de melhorias de acabamento, instala\u00e7\u00e3o de cabides no banheiro e colch\u00f5es novos.","3363":"","3364":"The Georgian style, the nice view of the garden and the cleanness. The peaceful, calm environment and the lights at night. I felt safe.","3365":"The constant  changing of the  guests in the other rooms of my apartment. It was a bit of a fearful exoerience as a solo visitor for 12 nights.","3366":"Brilliant accommodation for the price - especially because you are so central and well connected with public transport. Yes, the apartments are shared - we didn't see our flatmate but had pleasant conversations with other house guests. Breakfast was standard \"student cuisine\" and absolutely fine for the price. The giant scones were particularly delicious. Check-in was very helpful for all questions we had, the option to leave luggage at the cafe is useful and it was lovely even just walking around the campus.","3367":"Great location, the centre of Dublin. Just what you'd expect from a student accommodation room, with good addition of daily cleaning and housekeeping","3368":"Unfortunately my room was immediately adjacent to some building work (rhis was in the summer) so a very loud generator and equipment was in action  during working hours. The courtyard was also quite noisy at night but this was not unexpected. The key fobs are a bit inconsistent and easily deactivate themselves if kept near phones.","3369":"Student accommodation so bound to be basic, but was perfectly clean, with kitchen facilities and the cafe breakfast was excellent.Perfect location for a fraction of the price of some of the luxury hotels.","3370":"Nothing","3371":"The atmosphere on campus is wonderful. Staying in the middle of Dublin is great. The room with carpet, armchair and lots of wooden furniture was very comfortable. The setting was astonishingly quiet.","3372":"The bathroom was tiny and old, but spotlessly clean.The first two rooms we were offered were horrible and noisy, thanks to the housing\/welcome office we got something better.","3373":"The whole place is lovely, room in old building  with a nice aspect","3374":"The directions for drivers are terrible and can easily be improved as are the directions for actually finding the room - poor mapping all round.","3375":"location was excellent.  cafeteria was good and well priced.  Staff friendly.","3376":"Room was a bit too spartan for me, but perhaps I could have booked something better.","3377":"The location was great, right in the heart of town. Room was clean and comfortable. Shared bathroom was not a great issue. I hardly saw anyone else.","3378":"Locating my room was a bit of an issue, also the corridor was dark and I could not see where the light switches were. Once I knew, no issues.","3379":"Didn't have breakfast","3380":"I asked for a ground floor room as I am rather old. I had steps to negotiate then stairs to 1st floor room","3381":"Great place, friendly staff, very clean premises. For the price, this is a great place for a short stay!It was also important for me to be able to come and go at any time of the day.","3382":"Looks like it's time for a little facelift in the rooms (the carpet, walls and bathroom equipment are already visibly worn out)","3383":"The room was very comfortable indeed and quiet and peace full to be honest, the host is very friendly. Gives the feeling that He will bend over backwards if you need assistance with anything he can help with. Highly recommended. Definitely would be back there to stay again north side. \nI had important documents to be printed which were hand delivered to the door and there were basics in the fridge included also.","3384":"If you want to feel the spirit of Dublin city of past century, you should visit this property. The room is normal size, with everything you might need, including converter plug. You would be able to find everything for self cuttering. Host is very responsive and always reddy to help you.The bathroom is small but comfortable.","3385":"Cleaning service may be a bit better","3386":"Leo was GREAT!","3387":"NA","3388":"Excellent value for money. Very comfortable bed and good facilities to store and heat up meals ourselves during stay. A very short bus journey to town centre and on excellent, frequent bus service to explore Dublin and surrounding areas. Tea, coffee, milk, juice and biscuits all provided. Leo kindly stored our luggage for us so we could explore Dublin without having to cart it around with us.","3389":"As noted by others shower room is small but didn't cause us an issue. Plenty space and large mirrors to get ready in bright bedroom.","3390":"Very nice host and comfortable beds. We liked the window in the bathroom and the location of the apartment in a beautiful alley close to the botanical gardens. The host gave us some good recommendations for dinner and breakfast and was always there for help or a nice talk.We had a nespresso machine and he had equipped the room with everything one could need, like milk and orange juice, coffee, electrical plugs and little snacks! Very nice!","3391":"The bathroom was a little small but fits everything needed. At night it was a little loud because it is an old building, so make sure to pack some ear plugs, then it should be fine.","3392":"It was a wonderful place to live in along with the best services. Location is easily accessible . The host is a very good human.","3393":"Nothing to complain","3394":"Everything was very  nice. Highly recommended \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0160","3395":"Excellent place .Leo was very kind and helpful","3396":"Handy location as it was on main bus route.  The host was very friendly.","3397":"Very tiny and old fashioned room with very basic facilities.  The bathroom was extremely small and difficult to move around.","3398":"Such a nice and cosy place to stay and the host Leo was really nice and helped us when needed","3399":"Great value and free parking which is great for college. My class was literally around the corner. Rooms are huge and really warm. Beds are really comfy and not too much noise around at all.","3400":"Quiet and comfortable","3401":"Checking in difficult,  reception closed. Was aware of this as propty had called me twice to explain the procedure.  Gate's locked from 11pm, so if later needed to walk around the building from carpark","3402":"Good location for airport, room was clean and mostly comfortable","3403":"Uni students don't sleep. I stayed a Wednesday night and I could hear  ppl.partying, at different levels, all night.  Made it very difficult to get a decent sleep","3404":"Handy location for early flight. We got it at a good price and 15 mins from city and airport. Great spot","3405":"If you check out early there may be no one around. We just had to leave to key into security","3406":"Comfortable bed, clean, lounge area, free wifi","3407":"Loud at 1am, check in after 8 is with security, very thin walls, shower overflowed. It's cheap for Dublin but still so expensive for what you get.","3408":"I didn't take breakfast, but the location was peaceful, and not too far from necessary amenities. I also like the free parking The apartment is well maintained, and the security is good. I recommend it to other travellers.","3409":"Nothing","3410":"Clean free parking","3411":"No AC","3412":"Close to airport","3413":"Hot, window could only be opened 4 inches, no fan available","3414":"Given the fact it is student accommodation, it was above my expectation, lovely staff and great coffee bar, it's a step up from a hostel, reminded me of my own university days on campus, lovely grounds to walk around also.","3415":"Nothing, perfect for price and location.","3416":"Room was very comfortable & clean","3417":"Would have liked a coffee shop on the campus","3418":"Citybreak apartments are always great to stay in. super clean. Nice safe areas close to everything. Highly recommend.","3419":"nothing","3420":"It was a very good apartment located in a great area. Lots of food and drinks options outside, with nearby convenience stores for groceries if you need it. The apartment had complete items you'd need for the kitchen and even had a sitting area for meals.","3421":"We travelled with a toddler so it was difficult for us to run up and down the stairs until the 3rd floor. We also asked for a baby cot right from the booking, which they immediately confirmed will be placed in the room. We checked this while checking in also and the receptionist confirmed, however, the cot wasn't there when we got to the apartment (keys need to be taken from an entirely different neighbourhood, btw). We had to wait for about 3 hours for the cot, and that was very unfortunate after a long travel day with a toddler who was very tired.","3422":"1. The location of the apartment is very central. 2. the apartment itself is very clean and modern.","3423":"1. The hassle to have to pick up the keys in the other side of the town.2. Water pressure in the shower is weak3. The neighbours upstairs have a VERY loud floor, you can hear them a lot. I woke up early in the morning because I thought that someone is banging on our door, but it was just the neighbours upstairs. It didn't help that their children were running around all the time.","3424":"The bed was comfortable, tv was big with loads of channels to choose from, the shower was very good, the kitchen was fully equipped including a washing machine. Overall our stay was cosy and pleasant.","3425":"Room was a bit small was expecting it to be bigger like the photos, nicer upgrade for the kitchen would be a microwave.","3426":"- Room was well equipped. Small but everything was in place- Everything was clean- Perfect location for my purposes- In general I am happy with the stay","3427":"- Photos were showing different room than the one I got- You have to collect keys in a different part of Dublin (Dublin 1 neat the Spire)- A bit funny smell in the room","3428":"GREAT LOCATION FOR SHOPS.

Incredible comfort.","3445":"n\/a","3446":"location","3447":"very very cold in the room . \nif the heating system is that poor extra blankets should be provided","3448":"Buffet breakfast lacked taste.","3449":"We chose this hotel because of its location, it's right in the center at walking distance to the main Dublin attractions, buses, and tram.The decoration of the common areas is stunning, very tasteful. Room is big enough, cosy, bathroom is beautiful.The staff at the reception is very friendly, polite, helpful and speak other European languages.","3450":"Poor breakfast.The extra bed was very uncomfortable.The curtains were transparent, so there was too much light in the room during the night and early morning which ruined my sleep.","3451":"Great hotel, the location is perfect for \u00e0 WE in Dublin.","3452":"Hotel personnel not really on point when we asked questions.","3453":"The location is excellent, the Hotel was great, the room was superb, very comfortable.","3454":"Nothing!","3455":"Comfy bed","3456":"not being able to pay cash in the hotel bar","3457":"Loved this hotel.

Very quiet and comfortable with all amenities needed. Will book again","3478":"This isn\u2019t a negative but we were on fifth floor with no lift. Travelled with 80 year old who struggled. Was unaware of the stairs but that might of been my oversight.","3479":"Beggars Bush was a great location. Pretty quiet, but near plenty of pubs and restaurants and a nice walk to the city center. The room and bathroom were very clean and the staff were extremely kind and helpful. Would definitely recommend!","3480":"The staff are all very friendly and pleasant with guests and also to each other - there is clear positive energy between the members of staff and a really good feeling in the place as a whole.

The breakfast was nice and nourishing. The breakfast room was cozy and we felt ourselves as being at home. The personnel were kind and helpful. It is very warm in the hotel. We were lucky with the weather and didn't use the heating. The bathroom was very clean and shiny. There were sounds from other rooms but it depends on the building construction. The hotel is situated in the close area to the center. Just take a bus and in 10-15 minutes here you are in the center. The location is quite good. There are lots of pubs next to the hotel, Tesco and good restaurants (as Yoi - japanese one that we recommend very much)","3486":"Dear guests! Never ask for booking a taxi without knowing the exact price. We were faced with a very disappointing experience when a receptionist (Czech woman) offered us to take a taxi to the airport. She wanted to be helpful and probably didn't know the price. We were told that it must have been as usual approximately 22-25\u20ac. I do not know the company she ordered but the driver changed the price for 47\u20ac on the way to airport. In the car we noticed that the driver had got a rating 1 (!!!!). Lately we understood why.\nI ask the personnel to help guests to know the price in advance  and, please, l ask the personnel not to use this taxi company anymore","3487":"The location of Waterloo Lodge is great. Check in and put process was easy and efficient. I had a large spacious room that was very comfortable. The shower was great and the room rate was good value for Dublin, would stay again :-)","3488":"The location of my room was in lower ground floor so there was little natural light and have to walk through the breakfast room to get to room. Given the building is old the floorboards creak so I could hear the ceiling squeak from other guests walking on the floor above me","3489":"The location is perfect for attending embassies in the area and an easy bus ride from Hueston Train Station. The price is reasonable considering Dublin is a complete rip-off. The building itself is acceptably clean with powerful and warm showers. The beds were very comfortable and the lenin was clean.","3490":"The receptionist spoke good English, but couldn't listen to a word of what I requested which is really frustrating. The rooms are tiny if you prefer a little space and although advertised, there is no breakfast.","3491":"Clean, location, good breakfast, comfortable.","3492":"It was like a sauna, the heating was very high in the whole hotel for the duration of the stay. My shower was slightly faulty and power would drop every few minutes for about 30 seconds.","3493":"Excellent staff.","3494":"Although the room.was not very spacious it was comfortable and clean.","3495":"The breakfast info were a nit confusing","3496":"One of the best places I have ever been so far!!!

The staff were very friendly, helpful and good-humoured. The hotel has a lovely sense of personality.","3498":"My bathroom was a little bit grubby, but I would not be prepared to complain at this price. I had meant to mention to a member of staff that there was quite a lot of mould on my window - this is more serious and I do think it is something that should be fixed.","3499":"they close 6th Feb.2023","3500":"It was very cozy and all of the staff were very friendly! The cafe downstairs was excellent!! It was also close to the tram line and bus stops so it was easy to get to the city center.

We came from the UK so it was okay but it would not be a fun journey if you were coming from far.","3514":"Only the collection of the keys were not up to satisfaction, everything else was okay. Beds were comfortable, however kitchen doesn't have basics like salt or pepper so cooking was difficult. Hot water took a long time and cooled down really quick as well.","3515":"place too cozy","3516":"I haven't access to kitchen stuff to help me there, and TV didn\u00b4t work.","3517":"Posizione","3518":"","3519":"La cercan\u00eda con el centro","3520":"","3521":"Era muy peque\u00f1o y el sof\u00e1 cama muy inc\u00f3modo","3522":"","3523":"La posizione \u00e8 fantastica, vicinissima al centro e a tutte le principali cose da vedere a Dublino.

Zona piena di locali e tranquilla di notte.","3524":"","3525":"L'appartamento \u00e8 davvero piccolo, confortevole, ma minuscolo, poco insonorizzato (e i vicini sono un \"tantino\" rumorosi!!).

Fatto il check-in, ci sono state consegnati le chiavi, ci hanno detto l'indirizzo di dove si trovava la camera (\u00e8 un aparthotel che ha camere in molti edifici del centro della citt\u00e0) e siamo stati abbandonati a noi stessi. Ovvero la camera si trovava in un altro quartiere della citt\u00e0 e abbiamo dovuto fare da soli, poich\u00e9 non esiste alcuna navetta che accompagna gli ospiti nelle varie camere sparse per il centro della citt\u00e0. Arrivati in camera ci siamo accorti che non era la camera che avevamo prenotato. La camera fra l'altro era sporca, c'era il letto disfatto con le lenzuola sporche, spazzatura in camera e il bagno sudicio. Abbiamo chiamato alla reception e dopo 15 minuti \u00e8 arrivato il receptionist il quale resosi conto che la camera non era stata pulita ci ha assegnato un'altra camera in un altro quartiere della citt\u00e0, ci ha detto l'indirizzo e ci siamo dovuti arrangiare per arrivarci. Per fortuna che non pioveva e non faceva molto freddo. Arrivati a destinazione verso l'una di notte, dopo essere stati sballottati a destra e a manca per la citt\u00e0 a piedi e da soli, ci spiega che in quella camera ci possiamo stare solo due notti e poi dovremmo fare il cambio. Invece no, l'indomani all'improvviso ci chiama il receptionist dicendoci che entro mezz'ora dovevamo lasciare la camera e prenderne un'altra. Io arrabbiatissimo del trattamento che ci stavano dando, chiedo di parlare col direttore ma guarda caso il direttore quel giorno aveva il giorno libero! Ho chiesto di potergli parlare il giorno successivo, ma lo stesso non era possibile parlargli. Ho chiesto che per tutto quello che era successo mi sarei aspettato uno sconto sul prezzo totale, ma hanno fatto orecchie da mercante! Questa struttura \u00e8 mal organizzata e non esiste minimamente la professionalit\u00e0! Per quanto riguarda il rapporto qualit\u00e0 - prezzo posso solo definirli INCOMPETENTI e LADRI!","3544":"","3545":"everything was great. loved the rooms so tasteful spacious and comfortable","3546":"Friendly, helpful reception staff, Manager on duty Chloe couldn't have been more helpful, room spotless, central location, excellent breakfast & dinner options.

When we checked out we also had the option to leave our luggage before making our journey home which let us squeeze some last minute exploring before catching our flight back. Rooms were lovely and clean and although we never dined in the restaurant the food smelled lovely! Ideal location, would definitely return!","3550":"We were welcomed by very friendly and helpful staff who kindly let us check in early as we had a wedding that day. Breakfast was amazing!

He also helped us find parking and gave a bunch of suggestions on things to do. \nEverything was great and worked well.  Wifi was good, bed was comfortable.

Our experience here had been so good on our first 2 nights that we were looking forward to staying for another 2 nights before heading back home. We stayed in 2 different rooms and both were nice, clean and comfortable. The reception staff were lovely. On our second stay, we arrived very late at night when reception was closed, but someone who was on call came to check us in. Morehampton Townhouse is well located, as it only takes about 25 minutes to walk to St Stephen's Green. We also found very nice restaurants in the area. I highly recommend this place!","3727":"Warm and clean","3728":"Excellent service and very clean and good sized room.","3729":"Room was slightly too warm overnight and I didn't see any way to reduce the temperature.

All the comforts and services of a hotel room but with the added communal space of a house allowing us as couples to relax together rather than go back to a hotel and disappear into separate rooms. Doug the owner was very helpful and allowed us to check out late due to a late return flight which was much appreciated.","3742":"n\/a","3743":"Door code arrival easy property clean well equipped 20 min walk to temple bar","3744":"The townhouses were nicely decorated, and well equipped with everything we could need. Doug was very communicative and made the check in process really easy. The townhouses are only a 5 minute walk from the Guinness Storehouse (well worth a visit) and a 20 minute walk from Temple Bar.","3745":"Booked 2 of the houses for a family trip for a 40th and 60th birthday for 8 of us..I arranged with Doug to put some banners up for our arrival and also for some  prosecco to be put in the fridge for us. When we arrived later than expected due to flight delays after Storm Eunice, it was lovely to see the houses with heating on and looking so inviting and balloons, banners, fresh flowers and even birthday cards and the bubbly nicely chilled. We were over the moon, cant thank Doug enough. Liberty townhouses are a real home from home. Well equipped, clean and comfortable with everything you need and just a short walk to Dublin town centre.\nDoug the owner was very helpful and answered all my pre visit messages or questions promptly and nothing was too much trouble. Great service. Would hope to book again next time we visit Dublin and would recommend anyone to book here..Many thanks to Liberty Town Houses, cant think of anything negative to say.

The door frame below my eye level, shower cabin was barely the width of my shoulders, \nthe single bed was narrow & lopsided one spent the night hugging to the wall to prevent the mattress sliding off..\nif you get a 3rd floor room you have 6 flights of stairs to climb. No lift.\nNo breakfast.","3767":"Great location and easy self checking","3768":"The bed is hard and uncomfortable\nVery bad insulation outside, it looks like the window is wide open so a lot of noise. You can hear people talking in the street even though I was on the top floor. Let's not talk about the traffic noise and the nightclub just downstairs.","3769":"It was practically in town and close to everything and very child-friendly.","3770":"Quiet clean rooms","3771":"TV didn't work","3772":"Quiet room","3773":"TV in sitting area of room 611 did not work","3774":"Stuff was very kind and helpfull","3775":"The sink in the bathroom was a bit too small (15 cm x 20 cm) and the wardrobe was useless because missing shelfs and clothes hangers","3776":"We loved the privacy of the apartments! Perfect size for a short stay, and convenient to downtown Dublin.","3777":"There was an issue with the outlets & wifi when we first arrived, but the cleaning staff rebooted the fuses so everything worked from the second day onward.","3778":"The only reason I gave it a very good instead of exceptional is because there were two tv's & only one worked & the hot water took an ago to come through wasting so much water. I'd highly recommend this hotel its a little gem","3779":"They had been updating & I think that's why the TV wasn't working but the hot water may be more of an issue. I liked everything it was just these two issues. Never met better staff front of house or waiting staff so friendly.","3780":"Nice, modern one bedroom flat. It was very clean. There was a kitchen and an upstairs area with a sofa.   The staff were very friendly and the breakfast bar and restaurant service was excellent. The Irish breakfast was nice and hot when it arrived.","3781":"The room was freezing all night, despite turning the radiators on.","3782":"The location was very convenient for visiting the city, with a short walk to the tram.  Breakfast was nice, standard Irish Breakfast.  Room was spacious and had tea and coffee available.  The hotel had live music every night which was nice but was in the same room as the dinner so this might depend on personal preferences.","3783":"The Mews is out the back of the hotel in an alley way which wasn't exactly picturesque but felt secure.  Upon arrival the lock on the front door wasn't working so we had to wait an hour or so whilst they repaired it.  We were offered a coffee while we waited but it was an inconvenience.  The room was very cold and it took a couple of tries to get a portable heater from recetpion.  It seems they don't turn on the heat till later in the year, we were there in late September.","3784":"facilities, location, customer service","3785":"the seagulls dispersing the rubbish from the bins in the lane way","3786":"The staff! They made all the difference. Forever smiling, patient and accommodating. A big shout out to the wonderful people looking after breakfast and dinner. Your service with a smile is an example to follow.","3787":"The apartment view was not that great but a very minor thing. The carpet in the unit was stained or just needed more TLC.","3788":"Extremely helpful and friendly staff, great location, room was comfortable and stylish","3789":"really great location, loved the style, the rooms with additional touches. staff couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been more helpful and courteous","3790":"unfortunately the noise from the clubs beside the hotel meant a sleepless night until after 2am. despite ear plugs provided on the bedside lockers, these did little to muffle the loudness.","3791":"Hotel room was beautiful and bed was so comfy. The breakfast at Sophie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was incredible - best French toast I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried. Being able to order drinks to the pool was a bonus.","3792":"The website failed to mention the noise issue. Hotel is attached to a night club, in a row of night clubs. Our room was directly above the smoking area meaning that until 3am every night you can hear every song, word for word, even with ear plugs in.","3793":"loved the atmosphere and decor, thought it was really cool!","3794":"never a good sign when you see earbuds beside the bed but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on me, I forgot we were on the busiest nightclub street in Dublin \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u20ac","3795":"Everything","3796":"The website said free shuttle but it was not true","3797":"Great location. Lovely decor. Loved the room. And mini bar\/treats available.","3798":"Water was not hot for showers in the morning and this was a big disappointment and did not reflect the price we paid.","3799":"the food was amazing","3800":"liked everything","3801":"it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very central\nit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has a nice vibe and the finish to the property is really nice \nthe gym, health suite and bar areas were are brilliant","3802":"the clubs in the area were so loud at night and went on until 3.30\/4","3803":"it was absolutely incredible from start to finish, we had the best night there.","3804":"staff are very friendly, from the reception to waiting staff upstairs everyone is a pleasure to deal with. the location is brilliant and Sophie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has the best views of the city.","3805":"quite loud because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next door to a late night bar\/club, earplugs are provided which is a big help. I had a few drinks in so falling asleep wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue but this is not your location for a quiet night in.","3806":"Super hotelik w samym centrum Dublina.Polecamy","3807":"","3808":"location","3809":"shower and safe did not work, not clean, only one key","3810":"The location is ideal for pub nightlife. The accommodation was more than adequate for 3 guests.","3811":"The bathroom works fine, but needs updating. The was limited hot water in morning.","3812":"Lonely girl looking after breakfast area","3813":"Breakfast was terrible very greasy \nDrink prices in the bar were robbery","3814":"Although the breakfast was included in our price we opted for the small cooked Irish. It was small alright! Couldn't find the bacon on the plate. The sausage was shrivelled and a little bland","3815":"Windows in bedroom didn't lock properly so felt a bit uneasy","3816":"In the middle of Temple bar, bathroom was newly redone. Lovely people at the front desk.","3817":"Single glass windows, so it is very noisy. Even with earplugs you can still hear the music from the pubs around as if you are in the middle of the pub yourself. Room had no bathtub, booking said it should. Building is very old and could do with some renovations. It is not worth the amount of money now, but could be. For now you pay for location.","3818":"The view was lovely","3819":"The bed was old and lumpy and the room was too hot and no heating on very hard to open the windows","3820":"The property was right on temple bar which was a very good location.","3821":"Our room was very dated and old fashioned and smelt like cigarettes when we first arrived.","3822":"If you are looking for some nightlife, this is the place to be.","3823":"Windows super old, not the best for the noisy nightlife. However that's acceptable if you want to sleep in this area.","3824":"the fact that we had to ring the bell 5 times before someone came to open up. then we were told to wait in reception door about 10 minutes before someone checked us in. the location too noisy. the tv was also not working.","3825":"Nothing. The TV didn\u2019t work. Walls and carpet were dirty. The only seating was extremely uncomfortable. Beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. You could hear everything outside. Downstairs door was left unlocked by the person in the other apartment on several occasions and it didn\u2019t feel like a super safe area. On our last evening, we ran into someone coming down the stairs from our apartment, who could not have been coming from anywhere else. Shower was missing a door. Some blinds did not pull down. It was literally awful.","3826":"Everything. My first two nights a friend was staying with me until my husband arrived. My friend left to stay in a hotel on the second night because it was so bad. I requested a refund so I could go to a hotel the last three nights but they were slow getting back to me and I wanted to see the city so I stayed, but would not recommend to anyone. Now crossing my fingers that they return my security deposit.","3827":"Was fairly close to the center. Easy to reach by bus (get a day or weekend pass)","3828":"Really dirty and smelly (nicotine smell in the carpet and furniture) Mold in the kitchen and shower, flaking ceiling and dust over the complete apartment. Had to pay a \u20ac300 deposit, but when I did they were super slow to answer questions.","3829":"For the apartment nothing","3830":"For the service very poor i can't even cook for my family, because the stove is not good","3831":"The location was close to the city centre. Other than that, there is nothing positive to be said about this place.","3832":"This flat was totally filthy, a storehouse of rugged and broken furniture, dirty walls, rusty cutlery and worn-out sheets. The property is insecure, without fire protection, completely unhygienic and should be reported to the authorities. It is by far the worst place I have ever stayed at.The lock to the entrance was broken the entire week; it was ultimately fixed on the day before departure but had I not encountered the locksmith outside, who gave me a set of keys, I would have been locked out!","3833":"absolutely nothing it was a dump","3834":"it was an absolute dump probably the worst place I have ever stayed. we didn\u2019t even want to sleep in the beds. the shower screen was missing. it stank stale and like old cigarette smoke. there was blood on the walls down the side of the bed and just filthy stains everywhere. Even the neighbours were shocked we were staying there because they asked us if we were there to repair it. the ceiling in the bathroom was about ready to fall down. However there was a good thing about it and that was the door out of it. so please if you are going to book this place wear a full face covering to stop you from getting sick.","3835":"NOTHING","3836":"The hosts Hugo and Brian were utterly horrendous, they cursed at us through the phone and in person Refused to give us the keys even when we wanted to pay the deposit which may I add wasn\u2019t mentioned or included in the fees section It was the worst service I\u2019ve ever experienced and I don\u2019t wish the treatment I received by these hosts to even my worst enemy.I don\u2019t recommend you spend your money here at all !","3837":"Everything.\nApartment in state of disrepair, damages throughout including blinds either missing or broken. Bathroom shower and toilet broken and half used mouthwash in cabinets along with medicine not belonging to us. Stains on bedroom walls and lingering bad hygiene smells (vomit). Not child friendly in any way, our children did not feel safe. \nThe list goes on....\nRaised with host as soon as arrived, 6 days later finally get an apology but no reconition of issues other than they consider them to be 'minor issues', they are not minor.","3838":"It had a good bus connection to the town centre The beds were quite comfortable.","3839":"The light in one bedroom did not wirk properly, it went on and off. \nThere were really old used, many times fixed furniture, bins without lids e. g. in the bathroom. The hat water did not work at night, just in the morning at first, but we figured out how to change that. The shower was damaged and did not close \u2026 so the whole bathroom was under water every time somebody took a shower. Two of the towels had stains. The walls had stains, brown ones next to the toilet. The paint in the bathroom partly came off \u2026 \nI could continue for a while. I have rented apartments on booking before, but not in this condition.","3840":"Location and size of the apartment","3841":"First of all, when we arrived, we noticed a strong odour of nicotine. Didn\u2019t take too long to find out ashes all over the place, because the cleanliness of the apartment was very poor. The carpet was dirty and full of dust. About the heating system, 1 heater was working properly, 1 was working when it wants and 1 isn\u2019t working at all. We tried to take a shower, but the water didn\u2019t get an acceptable temperature. The basin in the bathroom was leaking, leaving the floor wet. The kitchen was ok, but the oven is unusable, dirty and with leftovers from other people.We tried to get assistance from the host but after the first complaint (about the smell of cigarettes), he didn't return our messages.Now we are hoping that he return our security deposit as soon as possible.","3842":"It\u2019s in a good spot handy for town centre","3843":"We had no WiFi which with the kids needed to play on iPads or phone which was disappointing because no tv there and it stated 24 hours free WiFi and think it could do with en upgrade just a little paint would help","3844":"simple, clean room. the B&B is close to botanic garden and glasnevin cemetary. to the city centre it is only a short walk.","3845":"sometimes, you can smell the smoke from downstairs","3846":"","3847":"Place was great, clean and comfortable. Easy check in, friendly staff","3848":"Nothing","3849":"The location is very safe and quiet. We had an American embassy appointment and this hotel was only a 9 minute walk to the embassy\u2026 it was perfect. The lady who answers the phone is extremely friendly and exceptionally helpful.","3850":"You get what you pay for. The room is a little cold and there is dust and mould in a few places. It is an old Victorian house. However the price is low for Dublin.","3851":"Calm neighborhood","3852":"Beda and Room fine. There was no breakfast.","3853":"Great location and great value for money. Rooms clean comfortable and warm","3854":"No parking, met zero staff during the stay","3855":"location, quiet, lovely building","3856":"rooms not serviced","3857":"close to the dart, very clean and quiet, staff was very communicative over messaging.","3858":"nothing, everything was great!","3859":"Check in was easy and manager was on duty everyday\nSmall room, nice big bathroom, room was warm enough which was important  for our stay in January, \nloved the location we walked to Ballsbridge for dinner all 3 nights had the best Thai meal (went there 2 nights) at Baan Thai.\nWalked into Dublin centre but caught uber home at the end of the day.","3860":"Decor is a bit dated but that didn't affect our stay","3861":"The property felt like home.","3862":"cleanliness and close to amenities.","3863":"Location is excellent. Twin room was a good size. Bathroom is clean.","3864":"Shower takes a long time for the water to run (5\/6 mins at least). Room was very cold, electric heater provided was not sufficient (and made noise) but admittedly it was a particularly cold night.","3865":"Very clear instructions and was a bit of an adventure. We felt satisfied that we solved the puzzle!","3866":"Nothing.","3867":"Location was good and ease with key and check in process was very good","3868":"Bit dated but was OK for what we needed furniture damaged unable to use draws in bedroom due to damaged","3869":"location","3870":"key\/lock front door difficult to use\nno wardrobe hangers\nin the bedroom which wasn\u2019t en-suite, the doors to the outside had a gap at the top therefore letting the cold air in\nvery \u2018modest\u2019 didnt seem if the owner took any pride in it","3871":"The views","3872":"The bed","3873":"Location suited us. a number of food options just at doorstep or short walking distance. . We even walked across the river\/ by the river. Pretty quick to get to the airport as well.","3874":"not as convenient picking up key from lock box simply because of my special circumstance - i had 2 young kids with me, had a rental car and no convenient parking for loading\/unloading heavy bags. So it was pretty difficult lugging bags  if you're an international traveller like us - and are weighed down with luggage. I think if the other half was present we would have managed better.","3875":"Great location. Comfortable. Very secure and safe","3876":"Needs TLC. Not much by way of extras - like coat hangers, pot towels and other basic things","3877":"Location, spaciousness.  Overpriced for what was provided.","3878":"The price considering what was provided.  For the price, I would have expected luxury accomodation.  A general update to the decor and fittings was definitely necessary.  At a considerably lower price the accomodation would have been acceptable, as it was, it was priced way out of my expectations.","3879":"The apartment is very well located for the Dublin Convention Centre. There are several grocery stores nearby which makes self-catering work well. There are also more restaurants and coffee shops than I expected. Possibly the nearby college has an impact. There is a Luas station right in Mayor Square adding connectivity. It is close to Epic and to the very interesting Jeanie Johnston replica ship. There is also a stop on the Dublin Express airport bus nearby on North Wall Quay.With two bedrooms and two bathrooms, a large livingroom and a dining area, there is plenty of space. The wifi is excellent and reliable, important for conference goers or if you are working.","3880":"When we first arrived the hot water wasn't working. There are no printed instructions in the apartment for the heating\/hot water controls, we had to google the model of controller. After some back and forth by WhatsApp with the contact at the company, it was clear that it wasn't a matter of settings, but there was no hot water. It took several days to get this resolved. Since there seems to be only one (!) key to the apartment, we constantly had to put the key back in the lockbox to give the plumber access. Once fixed, it was good and hot.The whole operation is entirely contactless, except for WhatsApp messages and the company website\/account, adding some stress to arrival. It is vital to get the 2 videos: opening the lockbox and finding and opening the gate. I had to ask for the lockbox video. It would be helpful to have more videos, such as on getting the fiddly apartment lock to open. Having only one key is also a problem when staying with others, since it is necessary to have the key to come upstairs even if one person is already home. In general the furnishings, although all serviceable, are getting worn and tired. The essentials are clean, but otherwise the property could use a deep cleaning\/refresh.","3881":"There was no breakfast.","3882":"Toilet seat that is not broken; White stains around apartment; Leftover refuse from previous tenant (birthday party supplies); front door that is functional; odorous smell in toilets.","3883":"Location was good near docks and restaurants and a tram stop. Apartment had two bathrooms, was warm and clean and located in a secure area.","3884":"Beds were lumpy with only one inadequate pillow even though extra pillows had been agreed at time of booking. Property responded to say pillows would come next day but they never did. Minimal cutlery and glasses. Lacked oven glove, tea towel, hand towels, soap. Washing machine in kitchen but no clothes airer.","3885":"perfect location, comfy bed, all was clean.","3886":"there wasn\u2019t water pressure in the shower, I thought I would stay there forever :D","3887":"The hotel is a short walk from Heuston Station.\nTea making facilities.","3888":"It was a twin room and I wss expecting a double bed. I also had trouble switching on the TV.\nThe location was handy for trains but also on quite a noisy junction.","3889":"Great Location, Very Clean, Friendly Staff","3890":"Nothing","3891":"Staff  where friendly,helpful","3892":"Back   door in downstairs bedroom","3893":"location","3894":"no bar","3895":"Room was neat and clean","3896":"Location is not in centre","3897":"Room was spacious, location was walking distnace to hueston train station and city centre. right next to phoenix park which was a bonus. breakfast was sparse but lots of other places to eat nearby.","3898":"Heat was off at check in so room was cold, however it was nice and warm at night","3899":"Location was very accessible, lovely view from window.

The owners are very friendly and helpful.","3904":"the level of finish across the entire property is of the highest standard. Loads of space, underfloor heating, real fire, massive bathrooms and 300m\nwalk to a beautiful beach.","3905":"Comfortable, spacious accommodation in a beautiful setting. Great hosts.","3906":"Everything about The Coach House exceeded expectation. From the outstanding and very personal service that Seamus and  Clodagh offered (nothing was too much trouble); the large, well appointed and immaculate accommodation (lots of personal touches) and the stunning location - all went to contribute to a wonderful family weekend.","3907":"WiFi a little sketchy.","3908":"The location was absolutely beautiful. Our hosts were amazing. The house (\"cottage\") is big, well furnished, comfortable and has amazing views of the lawn and area. Just step outside to the beautiful homes and walk a short distance to the sea and the train station. Stunning in every way!","3909":"We have absolutely nothing to say here. We loved it all. You have to be able to walk to the train station and back, but it isn't far.","3910":"it\u2019s position, close to shops and DART station , plenty of room for 5 adults , separate TV room for kids , 3 bathrooms , pleasant grounds and very private .","3911":"Can be slightly difficult to find the first time if arriving in the dark . Other than this , no issues whatsoever .","3912":"Well repurposed barn\nmodern facilities \nexcellent location\nvery extensive breakfast\nAnd above all lovey hosts","3913":"NA","3914":"A beautiful house, very nice hosts.

Room on courtyard was quiet","3923":"The stairs","3924":"Great location, good value for money considering how central it was. really comfortable bed too. shower was great!","3925":"only downside was the noise from inside of the hotel. could hear next door coughing or using the toilet, and people above us too. no lift either, not an issue for us but would be for anyone disabled or in a wheelchair, especially if placed on the third floor !","3926":"Staff was helpful and the room was spacious and modern, with a large bathroom and always clean.","3927":"The floors creaked and thin walls make for a louder than wanted room!","3928":"perfectly located, included parking, very comfortable, lovely staff","3929":"nothing","3930":"very clean & comfortable. excellent location very convenient for Dublin City centre.","3931":"Super clean, friendly staff. I always stay here when I come to Dublin.","3932":"Excellent location and value for money.","3933":"There was no problem when we asked for an extra blanket and sheet. The whole apartment is basically one room about 30-40sqm and almost 5m (sic) high.","3934":"There was not enough cutlery, but it was no problem to replenish on request.","3935":"We liked mostly everything, the space was big and clean. Cute little kitchen. Up the stairs was the bedroom very nice.. we liked the old architecture also.","3936":"It got very cold at night and the heaters didnt work so that was not good...","3937":"The studio was beautiful & very spacious.

Our teenagers enjoyed it very much. Overall prices are crazy in Ireland and especially in Dublin, this one remains quite expensive for an hostel compared to other experiences in other countries. So next year, we'll go to Scotland or elsewhere.","3948":"There were a missing curtain and an old granny that keeps her lights on all night long on the other side of the large street so...that's all...and Wifi code was not working","3949":"Very simple, nothing extra. Exactly only what's need for a good sleep, in very nice quiet environment. No street noise, no car noise. The bed very comfortable, cause very relaxed sleep.

A comfortable room with good amenities","3967":"Bedroom windows would be nice,but the building design doesn't allow it","3968":"Leo, the owner went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable.  He provided cookies, milk in refrigerator, and bottled water. Our room was cleaned several times during our stay with fresh towels and even a Irish Cream candy by our bed.\nLeo was the kindest gentlemen and made sure we knew what transits to take.

Two single beds are spring and not very comfortable for adult though my 5 year old slept fine","3973":"The people above us (unsure if townhouse guests or if they live there\u2026) had a massive row and for two straight hours all we heard was shouting, screaming, crying and stomping late in the evening. Was quite alarming and distressing for all. Not the responsibility of the accommodation manager, of course - but warning to say the sound barrier is minimal.","3974":"Well located for access to Dublin and close to some charming shops and cafes in Donnybrook","3975":"Beds were a little uncomfortable.","3976":"Quiet and convenient location, easily connected to city centre by bus, mini kitchen in the room.","3977":"Uneven bed, small room.","3978":"the location and the attention of the staff","3979":"It had no heating, only portable devices and the TV remote failed","3980":"clean plenty of effort went jnto having the likes of tea coffee milk\nbitter jam and cereals available. very hospitable. rooms\nclean and tidy and linen spotless.","3981":"there appears to be a leak in the living room just outside the bathroom door. wet patch on carpet from roof.","3982":"Good sized rooms and good kitchen.

Had freezing showers for 2 days.","4032":"perfect place to get head down, not too far away from Dublin centre. trams run at bottom of the street.","4033":"nothing","4034":"Comfortable bed, room was clean","4035":"I booked an ensuite, but the shower had cold  water. Disappointed","4036":"the architecture, vibe, atmosphere, decorations and the location.","4037":"comfy beds and plenty of showers","4038":"way too warm","4039":"I really liked the location (although was about 15 min walk to centre), felt safe and simple to navigate. Staff were helpful with check in and bag drop etc. The room was quite spacious for 8 people which was a bonus- the beds nice and private too.","4040":"A fair bit of older people- not a problem but I expected more a young hostel vibe.... Often old men in the common areas so not a vibe to hang out in.","4041":"Room was furnished to a high standard and was immaculate! Check in was super easy with clear instructions sent by direct message. The previous reviews don't do this place justice it's a lovely little spot for exploring the city. Will stay again","4042":"The bathroom was separate to the room but was still private and was very well equipped","4043":"We were very well received, the location is great and the room was cosy. It was good value for money overall :)","4044":"The room could be a bit cleaner and could also use a chair or extra table to be a bit more practical. A hairdryer would be a cool plus to add too.","4045":"Comfortable and well located.","4046":"Would be good to have coffee in the room.","4047":"Warmth, clean linen, location, teacups","4048":"No tea or coffee for the nice cups","4049":"Nice room","4050":"No heating so was a bit chill in the room,no coffee or sugar. Also was difficult to find","4051":"The bed","4052":"The dirty floor","4053":"location and sode of the room","4054":"Nice clean room, comfy bed, quiet but not too far from the city centre","4055":"location, tv, some chocolate and water offered. Cleaning was good and room was warm.\nThe owner offered a late check-out and communication was fast. Furniture okay","4056":"no heating and air dryer in the bathroom, floor leaking under the bed and close to the plugs (dangerous!), check in not possible on the time agreed (we were not told that the room was not cleaned yet). Room is quite small for the price paid.","4057":"We got exactly what we paid for a clean room and a comfortable bed!","4058":"Maybe an endtable by the bed would be nice.","4059":"Good location, easy check in and out, private room","4060":"loud guests, cold shower, thin walls, cold rooms.","4061":"The house lady is very kind and nice, always helping and I think she does a good job. Even tough I feel a bit sorry for her that she is settled to live in the room without Any window.","4062":"The house was in  really bad sitatuon. Not really nice there, not comfortable, kitchen is not nice to usd","4063":"Good location near city centre, bus stop is nearby. Room and toilets were clean. There was a friendly cat.","4064":"There was mildew in the bathroom. The windows are not well isolated. Passing cars and pedestrians are very loud. One can feel the springs from the bed.","4065":"Room was not too cramped. \n We had a window and our own sink.\nThe bus and train station are not far.","4066":"The neighbors are not quiet.  A podcast or TV talkshow ran all night in the backyard.  \nThere is limited hot water for showers.\nWe never saw any 'staff'.  \nThere are a lot of repairs needed in the house.\nNo breakfast or snacks provided as advertised.","4067":"Was cleaned regularly. Cleaner air and quieter than city centre. Good location next to park. Easy walk to essential shops and bus stop. Not far to city centre by bus. Bus route to airport. Can walk to train station, canal and botanic gardens.","4068":"Furnishings a little dilapidated. Would recommend a small table on landing so people can eat indoors - what do they do in winter? Move the bins from kitchen to back passage. Clear out all the leftover pantry supplies more regularly. A sign in the bathroom about what can and cant go down the toilet.","4069":"That I at least had a room to sleep in that night after my international flight was canceled.  To be fair I knew it was going to be just a place to crash so in that one way it was better than sleeping on the street.","4070":"Never met one person from property.  Initial code to get into property was incorrect but luckily I called to get that figured out.  Window in room was rusted and locked in open position.  Talking from external source outside was constantly coming from somewhere. Entryway was pitch black so had to use cellphone to climb stairs to room.  Shared bathroom lights did not work and door would not lock.  At least it had a bed with linens on it.  For what I needed it for it did the job but as a place I would recommend to anybody looking for more than a hostel like stay i wouldnt recommend it.  I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even stay the second night I paid for and moved on to a more suitable hotel.","4071":"Location was a bit of a walk from town but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem","4072":"The toilet didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flush, the shower had no curtain and was cold with no pressure. The room was dated, there was no tea making facilities in the room. It was a cheap room in comparison to others but was not fit for purpose.","4073":"It is not far from the bus stop and local shops.","4074":"No tv or radio and the internet password didn't work, got it sorted but it didn't match the one on the sign.My room was just a bed and a desk and a wardrobe.","4075":"Amazing property so close to Dublin City Centre","4076":"Good location, 5k fm centre bus route 2min walk. Comfortable tho very basic but Clean.","4077":"","4078":"the Shaw Suite was an excellent place to stay, I\u2019d highly recommend.

Super host","4085":"Gerry was very nice and allowed us to check in early. The apartment was lovely and clean and is in a wonderful location. Great vacation in Dublin!","4086":"the three bedroom apartment is beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  it is central to everything and the owner is kind.","4087":"we had difficulty with the shower every day of our stay, with the water supply proving to be erratic.  on reflection, on all but one day it worked in the morning but rarely after the pub downstairs opened.  that may just be a correlation.  the owner kindly dropped everything and came to our rescue but the repeated problem was frustrating as we had two members of our group that liked to work out at the gym in the morning and shower mid day or in the evening.","4088":"great location, good size","4089":"super noisy from the traffic and pub located below the apartment. also it was so hot and difficult to sleep","4090":"Erinomainen sijainti. Siisti ja viihtyis\u00e4 asunto.","4091":"","4092":"sehr sauber, gepflegt und mit allem ausgestattet was man ben\u00f6tigt. super Lage und sehr freundlicher und flexibler Vermieter. wir kommen gerne wieder.","4093":"","4094":"Superb value for money. Great location. Very friendly and helpful staff. Common bathrooms sparkly clean. Bedding, pillows and sheets well above expected quality. Fridge in the room. Sockets with usb plugins so no adapter necessary. Large selection of books.","4095":"Showers are top class.","4096":"Tv did not work and was not connected to an aerial","4097":"Great Location, close to the Centre of Dublin but not too close to the Temple Bar area","4098":"very basic accommodation, shared facilities, noise from street below from revellers returning from the Temple Bar area.","4099":"Location was perfect, looked forward to breakfast every day although we make it ourselves the host was very friendly and always had the coffee ready every morning. I even got some free pastries from his wife who happened to swing by after work at a cafe :)","4100":"Nothing!","4101":"The owner was super nice and helpful. The shared bathrooms, although not very luxurious, where clean and had everything we needed. The location was excellent, close to bus stops and only a few minutes walk to the city centre and main highlights of Dublin.","4102":"The guesthouse has a very good price compared to other options close by. It was not very luxurious, but it suited or expectations, and as we where only there at night, it was a great fit for us.","4103":"Great location.","4104":"Very noisy street, you can hear everything happening in neighborhood rooms.","4105":"The owner or the guy who works there is very friendly and always has a smile in his face. The location of the B&B is perfect, you can walk from there everywhere. Food is there, Pubs, stores, Lidl and Tesco.","4106":"This is just a personal issue from my side, because when I need to go to the Toilette I really need to go and as the B&B has no Toilets in the rooms, and only two for the guests you can come into really bad situations.","4107":"Location is in the city center close to all main attractions.\nFriendly staff.\nAlthough the room was basic it had a big TV.","4108":"WiFi was dodgy.\nLoud guests at night.\nWater in pipes is very loud when used in nearby bathrooms.","4109":"Nice location- very central, shared kitchen- very clean and organized, secure with door codes, keys, cameras; staff were very nice and helpful. Bathrooms very clean and kept up.","4110":"The upkeep was not great. It was clean- ish but the disrepair of the room sink and floor made it feel not clean. Sink was sticky with some adhesive sealant, floor had cracked spaces by sink. It was quite small. Water didn't get very warm to wash in the room. Wifi worked 50% of the time only and even then not reliable.  Upstairs bathrooms were very inconvenient to go up and down each time. Bathrooms were sparse. It was a very limited space for paying over 100 Euros per night. Also- no breakfast provided but fee was as high as bnb. They said there were places nearby to go eat!","4111":"Great check-in and helpful staff.","4112":"The staff was very friendly piolet helpfull","4113":"Location","4114":"No hot water \nNo Internet \nNo tv\nNo storage area\nLooks like it's a functional sitting room that waa turned into a \"bedroom\"\nNoisy front door\nNoisy guests above us\nLack of sleep","4115":"The room it's ok and the position also","4116":"We stayed 15 minutos under the rain because they didn't gave us the informations about the check in.And  when we called them they didn't answer.","4117":"Nothing","4118":"The room is not clean, no wardrobe to hang clothes the room too full of junk.","4119":"The bathroom was pretty new and clean. The bed was comfy and it is very close to the city centre.","4120":"- Whole house and room smells like cigarettes\n-not very clean, spider webs everywhere and not only small ones\n- no real contact to the owner \n-everything in the house is very loud\n-Stairs are broken ? You feel that they are not that trustworthy walking over them but you can't see anything because of the carpet \nAll in all I wouldn't stay there again. Too expensive for what you get. \nIf you want to enjoy your stay in Dublin and sleep well,spend some more money.","4121":"Be nice if some one could rent it out","4122":"The space of the room","4123":"location","4124":"contact with owner. no privacy","4125":"Location, room size was o.k","4126":"Very poor mattress. Can feel the springs","4127":"Actually a nice, old style dublin house, but run down quite a lot.","4128":"Backyard Breeding Dogs in the house, living in my opinion in horrible circumstances. The \"certificate\" in the hallway for officially breeding animals does not appear to be official at all. Worst smell of the animals all over the place, fortunately in the room not so much.","4129":"Location, friendly landlord.","4130":"Room and facilities well below par for \u20ac79 per night.\nStairs and banister broken, mould in shared bathroom with rest of house, ripped curtains and elic cables and plugs accross floor. Actually quite unsafe in general.\nThis room should not be listed on booking.com.","4131":"Amazing little find in central Ballsbridge.  5 mins walk from the RDS where we were attending a conference and exhibition.  The cottage was delightful.  Bright, breezy, tastefully decorated, well-equipped, comfortable.  What more could we want???  Friendly host (who we didn't meet) but they had good communications.  Will definitely be back!!!","4132":"It is such a beautiful cottage, its hard to find any negatives at all but, if I had to find one it would be that I prefer cotton bedding rather than synthetic.  I still slept really well in the super comfy bed though, so no problem all in all.","4133":"Beautiful snug cottage in the middle of the City. Couldn\u2018t want more.\nFlorentina was available the whole time. Thank you!","4134":"A wonderful quaint house to which we gladly returned after visiting the nearby attractions. A well-equipped kitchen with beautiful skylights, a comfortable living room and bedrooms. The house was one of the highlights of this trip.","4135":"Lockbox which is so handy!!","4136":"Parking is an issue! Better to use public transport which is easily accessible!","4137":"Great place to enjoy Dublin","4138":"Nothing","4139":"The property itself, the location","4140":"We had a few hiccups like the shower and hot water system but they were resolved quickly by the owner. She went out of her way to ensure we had a nice stay.","4141":"all facilities were there and is was cosy, lovely. Great location in a nice area.","4142":"the beds can be improved, for us not comfortable. also the traffic during nights was noticeable.","4143":"sehr sch\u00f6ne Einrichtung und super Lage. Check-in und out Zeiten wurden flexibel gehandhabt, das war f\u00fcr uns sehr hilfreich","4144":"","4145":"La cucina e salotto ricco di ogni confort,anche la parte esterna molto bella.Buona posizione.","4146":"","4147":"Camere e letti troppo piccole","4148":"","4149":"L'annonce donne dans ses points fort une place de parking mais en fait c'est du stationnement payant \u00e0 3.5\u20ac de l'heure.De plus, l'annonce dit que nous pouvons avoir le logement \u00e0 15h mais quand nous sommes arriv\u00e9s le m\u00e9nage n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fait et nous avons d\u00fb attendre sur le trottoir jusqu'\u00e0 17h30 que la femme de m\u00e9nage le fasse.","4150":"","4151":"staff were so so helpful, room upgrade was fabulous, room was beautiful, big and clean","4152":"nothing","4153":"It was spotlessly clean and a great size. The bathroom was fab, that shower is amazing! Also the girl who checked us in was the best!!","4154":"The parking.... if you are in a large vehicle or not great at parallel parking; it's a nightmare!!","4155":"Location.","4156":"no breakfast","4157":"clean warm quiet","4158":"they charge for parking and only have a few places","4159":"clean, friendly staff.","4160":"door to room didn\u2019t lock","4161":"It was perfect for us to attend Rugby event at RDS very comfortable and easy access with nice staff on the desk and all day coffee and tea available, which was a nice touch, very clean and efficient,","4162":"for some it may be a bit noisy from traffic but the windows are good","4163":"The bed was very comfortable and the room was lovely and  cosy","4164":"There was nothing I didn't like everything was so excellent  I would come and say there again","4165":"excellent location","4166":"clean,quiet,comfortable and good location","4167":"a bit pricey","4168":"Convince,  clean, friendly.","4169":"Duvet, lumpy and no option for additional blankets in the room.","4170":"There are no comments available for this review","4171":"Our family loved the Harcourt Suites!  The rooms were large and comfortable, but the best part were the small touches, like treats to go with the in-room coffee maker and comfortable shared sitting room!","4172":"Decoration was super nice, we felt at home! Also location is very central, everything is easily accessible from there.","4173":"We were only provided some body cream and shower gel but not any shampoo.","4174":"It was very homely, quite area and bed was comfortable.","4175":"The location is fine and still within walking distance of major attractions. It was also a quiet location when we visited over a Saturday and Sunday. Offering afternoon tea in the parlour was a lovely touch.","4176":"Overall,  it could do with a bit of TLC and maintenance. For example, the loose front door knob, the flush lever on the toilet and the tap in the sink in the parlour. A general tidy up in the yard would be nice as well.  A heads up to guests about giving the hot water time to heat up as well - it felt like it took forever to heat up. These are all understanable in an older accommodation, but do need to be addressed. A heavier curtain in the bathroom would also be good.","4177":"Great location and room","4178":"Noise from above ~ noisy neighbours late at night","4179":"the location is amazing and the staff were very friendly and helpful. the rooms are very big and beautiful","4180":"the bed was extremely uncomfortable. it sank down in the middle and we kept rolling in towards one another.","4181":"central","4182":"a bit of a weird smell in the hall\/landing","4183":"No breakfast.  Some finger food provided.  Overripe bananas","4184":"nice big room, comfy bed, cool building in a handy part of town. Random selection of cakes and pastries.","4185":"Confusing checkin process. Needed to read the emails carefully- one of the numbers provided they werent expecting us to ring about this property, just another one down the road. No bike parking as advertised (well, not secure anyway). But we could take our bikes upstairs and keep them in the room with us, fortunately.The landlord had offered us a partial refund as the shower head fell off onto my back, havent heard from him although he was really friendly when we were there..The room was pretty cold , with no visible option of heating it.","4186":"It was very suitable for attending the Eye and Ear Hospital. I  found the stairs a long way to climb. Refresh ments very good and welcome. Room large and  comfortable. Eating facilities and local places of interest would be useful.","4187":"Stairs but l am 83years old!!!!","4188":"Great location and facilities. Ideal for our trip","4189":"location","4190":"water system was noisy, no bedding for the single sofa bed.","4191":"Privacy for the family. Great location.","4192":"Floor has strange sticky thing. It makes feet dirty quite often. There is bit humidity. Sofa and table needs improvement.","4193":"Not applicable","4194":"Multiple defects in the apartment, garage was difficult to access, overall appearance of the apartment and the block was shabby and needed upgrading and a repaint.  Broken mirror in the bedroom, cracked handbasin in the bathroom, noisy cistern refill seemed to take 30 minutes after flushing the toilet. Kitchen was satisfactory.  Bedroom was OK and the bed was comfortable and warm.","4195":"cozy place, accommodating host","4196":"steep staircase","4197":"loved the location","4198":"apartment had a smell that did dissipate as we stayed. No hot water upon return to unit night before we left. was ok next morning.","4199":"Very comfortable beds and we were able to sleep 4 in the apartment just fine. Lots of media options on the TV and fast wifi. Washer and dryer in unit. Great location and very accommodating owner! The place was very clean as well.","4200":"Water went cold pretty quick and toilet takes a while to refill. No deal breakers at all, but a minor inconvenience for 4 people.","4201":"The apartment is exactly as shown in the listing. Check-in was easy with a lockbox right near the door.","4202":"Too much expensive because the apartament was lacking from all the point of view. No one told us how to do check in and check out. One bed was not ready, but guests had to make up it for the night.","4203":"The location was great (10 minute walk to Trinity or Temple Bar area.  And it was QUIET!  Friends of ours stayed closer to the bars and had noise all night long.  No noise here!  The host was easy to get a hold of and she came by and fixed the pullout bed when it wasn\u2019t staying connected.","4204":"The apartment is pretty dated.  The couch covering is ripping and our daughter found it very uncomfortable (hard\u2014she could feel the wood under the foam with her hip when lying on her side) for sleeping.  The windows open easily but because the apartment was at the same level as a 1st story roof that ran between the buildings and had maintenance shacks on it, etc, we didn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving the windows open at night.  Someone sticky was on the floors.  The host said that it was the result of too much floor cleaner being used, but that was disconcerting.  The angle of the shower head made it hard not to spray the entire bathroom with water.  So, for the price compared to other options in the city, it was fine.  But the pictures didn\u2019t quite match up with the experience.","4205":"Friendly and nice staff\nGot your own privacy in the room","4206":"comfortable bed, great staff, great location","4207":"low water pressure in the shower","4208":"Affordability, accessibility","4209":"It's 4 floors high and no lift","4210":"good location","4211":"pricey","4212":"Showers were super modern and lots of hot water, whole place was spotless, staff were super friendly and helpful. Couldnt have had a better experience! Would definitely recommend to any friends looking to stay in Dublin.","4213":"The endless stairs.","4214":"friendly staff, the kitchen has everything you need including dishes, microwave, ovens, toasters, sandwich makers, lots of fridges and shelves","4215":"the toilets and showers are quite old and the doors do not close well.","4216":"- only 4 beds in a room- comfort cozy living room","4217":"I arrived after 9PM and it wasn\u2019t possible to have a cup of tea in the hostel","4218":"Absolutely loved the bunk beds. I know someone here said they were like coffins but that is just the enclosed top one and it is like that with a secure wooden side so you don't fall out as triple bunks are high. The privacy is great with black out curtains on all the bunks so you can sleep if the lights go on and you feel like you can shut yourself off if you don't want to talk to other travellers. There is a small storage box at the end of the bed as well as a light and plug socket. The mattress was super comfy and the room was warm.","4219":"The weird thing was being sent a check in email which then asked for all your credit card details even though I had paid in full via booking.com. It didn't feel like a very secure site to be putting all your card details into including the CVC number and as I said I already had paid. You don't have to do this if you don't want to though and can check in when you arrive. I understand what people said about stairs as there are a lot to the third floor and I only had a small backpack. But the hostel is in a lovely street and the curtains on the bunks mean it is worth having to carry your bags.","4220":"The hostel overall is very nice and clean. The beds are really good as they are curtains for privacy.","4221":"The hostel did not fix the toilet near our rooms for more than 2 days and we have to walk all the way to the next level to use the toilet which is kinda annoying.","4222":"We weren't expecting the apartment to be as nice as it was. Past experiences with other places around the city are that the buildings are older, smaller and can be out dated, which is totally fine, but this apartment was quite large and had everything we needed. You don't have to leave the block to get most everything you need. You don't have to go very far for public transport, bars, restaurants and sites.","4223":"The price was higher, but that comes with the territory, as Dublin properties are expensive. We were on the top floor, and the window up the stairs wasn't reachable to open for air, but we were able to keep the apartment itself cool enough.","4224":"It was really close to points of interest. The beds are comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped. The easy self check in. Over all it was a nice experience as we were right in the center of Dublin.","4225":"The apartment is old and needs improvements. The courtains in one bedroom barely where kept by the strings.  The bathroom is old and not so clean. We bought a cleaning spray and cleaned it just to be sure. The light in one bedroom didn't work but we used the lamp from the night stand. The radiator's display from living room was broken.","4226":"location was fine","4227":"apartment is on the top floor of a three floor building (7 flights of stairs) - No lift (elevator). Apartment whilst all facilities are functional, was a bit tired. some side lights didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work and the main lights had many bulbs missing or failed.","4228":"- the location of the flat close to the city centre, windows facing the back yard avoiding the noise of busy street\n- quiet neighbours\n- easy check-in&check-out\n- daybreak store and pharmacy nextdoor","4229":"- cleanliness of the bathroom, weak pressure of  water in the shower, not sufficient light\n- missing kitchen towels\n- missing light bulbs in bedside lamps\n- quite often homeless people sleeping in front of the entrance door or people loitering there\n- open freezer in the fridge making foodstuff below it freeze\n- two separate taps for hot and cold water in the basin in the bathroom","4230":"Had character to it, good size rooms and beds, kitchen had plenty of utilities and some treats to greet us, staff were very friendly and quick to help","4231":"The shower ran very slowly when hot and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very difficult to find the point at which the water stays warm rather than scorching hot or freezing cold (it is possible but only 1 out of 4 of us managed it).","4232":"The location was great, and the size and comfort of the property. Beds are nice, easy to get keys, spacious and bright apartment. Communication was good once we checked in.","4233":"The shower is so awful, and the bathroom has just a dim light. The kitchen is missing a few essentials for a self-catering. Please add things like soap, something to clean with and a tea-towel. We bought these things, It could also do with a proper clean, there are hairs and dust all around, so the cleaning is not the best. I was also told I'd have to pay a deposit leaving me to panic and make the 350 euros available, but then they didn't even take it. Which is good just confusing, and communication about the deposit wasn't great.","4234":"Location is walkable to city centre and Dublinia. At some point this apartment would have been okay but is in dire need of repair","4235":"The address\/ directions were very unclear, the taxi had to drop us on the road, and it was very difficult to get through to anyone to ask for help. With luggage and 2 children on a busy road, next to a shelter where people were hanging around drinking and smoking this was a terrible start and it did not get much better. The apartment was filthy, I sent an email to our host regarding this, which was ignored. The chair covers were ripped, there was dust everywhere, and the toilet was broken. Andy, the manager, was very condescending, completely unhelpful. Do not stay here, the Jury's Inn across the road is a far better option.","4236":"I got an email AFTER booking that I needed to pay a security deposit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac260 to obtain the address\/details to get into the apartment. Scam. Scam. Scam. Scam. Please do not book here. We were left stranded in Dublin late at night.","4237":"Close to town centre \u00f0\u0178\u2018\u0152","4238":"Climbing all the flights of stairs to the apartment.","4239":"Nothing. It's a horrendous apartment, very dirty and run down.","4240":"The apartment is very dirty and run down:- stains on the pillows, on the curtains- the coffee table is overly used and damaged- no lightbulbs in the lamps (and the lamps have an EU plug but no adapter)- the bathroom sink is the most inane thing ever - two separate taps for hot and cold water- the freezer door is missing- barely any light in the bathroom- the shower is barely functional (either hot or cold, no inbetween)- lots of dust and grime everywhere- we complained about the cleanliness and, indeed, they contacted us after a few days (but we were out an about and were not able to answer) to send someone to fix the shower- in the final day they did manage to get in contact with us (to inform us that there will be someone sent over to change the matresses)- in that final day they also informed us they will refund one full day for the trouble we've had with cleanliness, however now they're saying they'll be refunding us only 100 euros (why go back on your word?)Basically, stay away - this is a huge scam.","4241":"Great location. Could walk to city centre.Very, very clean. Friendly owners and really appreciated that Paddy let me leave my luggage for the day. I thought the price was amazing and appreciated having my own bathroom. I stayed in the mini double room and while small it was more than adequate for a person travelling alone. Bed was very comfy. Lots of towels and I liked that I could open the window and view the street outside","4242":"Everything was great!","4243":"Quiet and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size.  Close to the train station and lots of connections to the city.","4244":"Nothing","4245":"I like the design of the bedroom and the comfort. \nI liked the carpet and table provided.","4246":"The TV didn't have any channels working, it was in a bad position also. \nI also didn't like I had to leave the room to enter the bathroom.","4247":"Very good stuff and place.

Warmly recommended!","4257":"everything was ok for that price.","4258":"Mark is very friendly, helpful. The location is great.

I booked last minute and I saw online earlier in the day that another room was also free. I asked to changed room to a room that had curtains but I was told there was no spare room. I saw the room next to me ajar all night, it was an empty room, bigger then mine BUT it did have curtains. I felt it was terrible to put somebody in a room they paid for at the front of a house with just a net curtain. It wasn't acknowledged and they didn't care at all. I was told they were being washed and would be back in a few days.","4271":"Small house but snugy! For me was important location. And location was good. For short term trip it's Ok but for long term - No.","4272":"Smell of paint was not pleasant and annoying.","4273":"Unclean.","4274":"having stayed here previously, I knew location was ideal for me","4275":"the room was quite cold and there no curtains on the window","4276":"Great location. Lots of space for parking. Cosy room.","4277":"There were no proper curtains on the window, just a sheet of lace. The window overlooked a busy road, meaning that if the lights were on, anyone could look up from the street and see right into the room. There was also visible damage to the front door. When it came time to check out, there was no one available and no instructions about leaving a key.","4278":"Parking","4279":"This property is an old type house, with 1 bathroom serving 5 rooms a possible  10 + people  very meager .  The rooms are adequate cups etc could do with a clean, very little in coffee\/ tea   but worse still no access to clean water in the modern era  no mains water??  I would recommend this place on a very low budget scale Expect little and got little,","4280":"The bed was very comfortable","4281":"The carpets were dirty, there was no mirror in the room, on top of the wardrobe there were clothes, dirty towels in the drawer, tea & coffee area was dirty","4282":"Bed was good, room was tiny. Staff was very friendly if not a bit distracted.","4283":"Shared bathroom. Not a problem but there was virtually no water pressure making both showering and flushing the toilet virtually impossible. Very noisy too. Hoovering was done in the other rooms until 9pm.","4284":"Close to the Luas and price was good! Staff were friendly","4285":"We had to pay cash which was disclosed only when we arrived and it took a while to get checked in.","4286":"The property was excellently located, just a block from the Sandymount DART station.  Despite the weather being rainy and cold, we stayed warm inside.  The beds were very comfy and soft, and the television channels offered a good diversity of programs.","4287":"The nearest grocery is approximately 750m away from the property.  The kitchen had enough tea for us, but no coffee and no sugar or sweetener.","4288":"La casa y la ubicaci\u00f3n muy bien","4289":"","4290":"Pidieron fianza de 1000Euros y he tenido que contactar con booking y hacer muchos tr\u00e1mites  para la devoluci\u00f3n, no hab\u00eda manera de ponerse en contacto con el propietario, han tardado mas de un mes en devolver el dinero.","4291":"","4292":"la ubicaci\u00f3n y las camas muy c\u00f3modas","4293":"","4294":"There are no comments available for this review","4295":"There are no comments available for this review","4296":"There are no comments available for this review","4297":"This was the perfect location for our last night in Dublin. It was very close to the airport and they include shuttle services to the airport. The apartment we got was on the 15th floor and there was a balcony with a great view of Dublin. The rooms themselves were a bit small but there was a living room and kitchen that was very spacious. I would definitely stay here again.","4298":"in general","4299":"the boiler water system: was noisy","4300":"Good location close to airport.","4301":"Many heavy doors in apartment that were noisy and would lock unexpectedly.","4302":"Supper and breakfast were both good","4303":"the cleanliness and comfort","4304":"outside property needs to be tidied a little more.","4305":"The apartment was spacious and clean.  The cooking facilities in the kitchen were more than sufficient to cook the food we bought at the Lidl store just down the street.  The beds were comfortable, and the bathroom worked well.  The room includes a long, enclosed balcony from which the view is fantastic (we were on one of the upper floors).","4306":"For some reason the bathroom was hot when we arrived.  The heat was not on, yet it must have been 90 degrees in the bathroom and surrounding area.  The hotel staff brought us a large fan, which we used to cool the bathroom down (we opened all the sliding glass doors in the apartment to let the cool outside air come in).  The other problem was the combination washing machine-dryer; there were no instructions and no manual, and the controls used hieroglyphic-style symbols, which meant nothing to us.","4307":"The rooms were very hot for some reason","4308":"Overall the apartment was wonderful, but there are a few things lacking or needing improvement:Lack of instructions for things such as thermostats, washer\/dryer, balcony lights, no dishwasher nor laundry detergent provided, no standard items such as body wash, shampoo.  Incredibly warm, so required three fans to keep bedrooms comfortable for sleeping.  Incredibly small shower in second bedroom and we're not oversized people.  Lastly living room furniture sleek looking, but incredibly uncomfortable - design error!  Could use another chair in that room as well.","4309":"The view was amazing","4310":"I could have had helP to carry things up to the 14th floor. No trolly to use to assist","4311":"The place was clean and warm the staff were super friendly","4312":"Lots of noise outside","4313":"Very clean (bedroom, bathroom, kitchen), free food for breakfast, very nice people and staff ! Close to everything, 10-15 min walk to get to the centre","4314":"The Garden Backpackers hostel was excellent. It is very small and quiet, and has just about everything you could want in a hostel. The vibe is very relaxed and chilled, it's in a residential neighbourhood but very close to the centre of Dublin.","4315":"Honestly, nothing. The only thing I would say was there was only 1 bathroom for each of the sexes on our floor, and 1 disabled toilet so 3 in total. The toilets were also in the same room as the shower, so if someone was having a shower you couldn't use the toilet. This didn't cause a problem for me but I can imagine it might in some cases.","4316":"location","4317":"it was very hot at night so open the windows","4318":"easily accessible , clean","4319":"flat pillows","4320":"Cozy and clean","4321":"Very clean hostel and very friendly staff","4322":"The man snoring beneath me, but hey, that's hostel life \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201a","4323":"easy to access and comfortable","4324":"nothing","4325":"The location is very good.\nThe friendly atmosphere especially in the third floor as they have a nice living room where we gathered every night. Also they have a kitchen in the third floor.\nThe staff was super nice!","4326":"Almost nothing.","4327":"Quiet","4328":"nothing","4329":"It was a comfortable hostel. I slept well. Staff were friendly.","4330":"All accomodation in Dublin is very expensive, so this hostel is cheap by Dublin standards, but expensive by all other standards.","4331":"The owner, Terry, is extremely friendly and helpful, made the stay great. Peter was also wonderful at check-in, giving a map of the area, tourist reccomendations,  bus routes, and even offering coffee or tea! Overall a wonderful little spot in a nice quiet neighborhood, slightly out of the way from the city center but not so far that you couldn't bus or taxi in a reasonable amount of time. Extremely impressive for the price, especially on a weekend in tourist season. I'd definitely stay here again if I ever get the chance!","4332":"Very friendly family team.  Helpful with directions, transport and information. Very comfortable warm room. Good location for Leopardstown Racecourse and coach from Airport.","4333":"Nothing! Minor suggestion would be a thicker or larger towel in the shower room and maybe a fan heater or heated rail.","4334":"very cozy place to stay.","4335":"The room was lovely. It was great value and the staff couldn't have been more helpful.","4336":"Proximity to public transport","4337":"very comfortable room with heating working to perfection.","4338":"ALL VERY NICE","4339":"Beautifully decorated, impeccably clean, lovely staff, felt very welcomed. Great transport links","4340":"The walls are quite thin and I could hear the neighbouring rooms, but it didn't bother me too much","4341":"Wonderful welcome, warm and cosy room, bed was divine and this guest house is also very conveniently located.

Would be nice to have available late check-in hours, in order to not have required taxi transfer (flexibility).","4350":"The hosts were very pleasant and extremely helpful","4351":"There are very few facilities--restaurants, shops,etc. --nearby, and it is farther from the airport than we had expected.","4352":"The bedroom, kitchen and bathroom were very clean and served our purpose to have 4 adults sleep before leaving from Dublin Airport. Owner runs a taxi service to the airport.","4353":"Place is small. We had to.move table and chairs to move out the pull-out couch.","4354":"It looks exactly how it does in the pictures. Modern, self contained, we could come and go as we pleased. On site parking, actually quite a good location for the city centre.","4355":"There was no hot water for the shower (but we didn\u2019t address this with the owner so could have been something we did wrong)","4356":"Had everything you could possibly need. so clean and modern and a great use of space. host was very accommodating. best value for money Ive seen in a long time.","4357":"everything was perfect for us.","4358":"The decor was lovely.

They assisted us with our bags and gave us advice on bus fares an helped us get around the city. The house doesn't have any parking but he let us know which areas were available for free parking and helped us to navigate over to those streets successfully.","4375":"The house is on the corner so we could hear the cross walk beeping all night and it was a little rough while we were trying to sleep -- this is no fault of their own and I don't hold it against them in any way, but maybe bring a pair of earplugs to get a restful night sleep.","4376":"No breakfast just lodging","4377":"It was ok","4378":"As long as I had a bed and a roof over my head,  I am happy.","4379":"I have no complaints.","4380":"This review has been hidden because it doesn't meet our guidelines.","4381":"Very affordable accommodation, it wasn't a five star hotel but very pleased for the money I paid. Location was perfect for me and my group, will be sure to stay here again.","4382":"The staff were super helpful, gave us great tips for seeing the city. We were allowed to check in at a time that suited us and the staff made sure we were comfortable with our room.  I really could not recommend this accommodation more and look forward to staying again.","4383":"If I could give this 100 stars I would. Location is spectacular, staff are extremely helpful, even gave us travelling guides for our stay which was a major help with our sightseeing activities. Amazing location for food. The James Connolly bar was right at the door step and served great food. I would not hesitate to book, cannot wait for our next stay ! Look forward to our next visit.","4384":"If you are looking for affordable basic travel in Dublin this is the place to stay. Staff were so helpful and accommodating to my group, helping us source great places to visit and during our stay. Regarding location the accommodation is in the heart of the city literally 5\/10 minutes walk from everything.","4385":"I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff were super helpful, location was fantastic and the room exceeded my expectations. The location is great with many places to eat and drink and shop surrounding.

Clean and comfortable bed, at a very reasonable price.","4395":"It was really cheap for Dublin. It was a little old but enough to take a shower and get rest. The owner was really pleasant. The dogs were friendly.","4396":"The floor of wood was really noisy. The mattress was a little uncomfortable. The dogs were a little annoying.","4397":"Awesome stay, short walk to the bus, a few decent pubs and coffee shops in the area as well. Next time we're in Dublin will definitely be in touch!","4398":"It was very cosy and ideally located to get into town. The lady running it was also so incredibly welcoming and kind, I felt right at home. The room was very cozy and comfortable with my very own kettle and teas as well as some fruit and some biscuits. It was very nice and I will definitely be coming back next time I am in Dublin.","4399":"Nice cosy room with a very friendly and helpful host. I liked the fruits and waffles a lot, it was a nice surprise to find them on the table :-)","4400":"We just loved our host! The place is very near to the city center!","4401":"The water pressure is very low and it's almost impossible to take a proper bath, also for the time being there was almost none hot water","4402":"Property was in a quiet residential area outside the city centre","4403":"Room was small","4404":"Located in a calm and peaceful neighborhood while not too far away from downtown.

Perfect for a couple.The owner is very nice, polite and friendly and respect the privacy of the tenants.","4405":"The shower isn't the greatest because the water pressure is very weak and the water temperature is lukewarm at best but it's still does the job.","4406":"L'accueil \u00e9tait super sympa.

It was comfortable.","4419":"We were greeted so nicely by our lovely hosts we immediately felt at home. Everything is clean and comfortable and the free cereals were delicious.","4420":"It made us realise that we aren't used to bunk beds anymore.","4421":"Comfortable and cozy room.

Very close to the bus stop and some city museums. Airy apartment for a family with 2 kids.","4428":"There were some missing things in the kitchen (e.g. 3 forks for 4 people). I couldn't get access to Wifi. The host didn't answer my message. And also we had to buy a travel adaptor.","4429":"There is a kitchen stove and a washing machine  though we didn\u2019t do any laundry as  buying a full box of  laundry detergent would add to our luggage weight. There is also a sofa bed although it wasn\u2019t easy to tuck it back in the morning.","4430":"The location in Corn Exchangec is quite far from Heuston rail station and it was difficult to get a taxi at 8am to go to the station. We booked with Lynk.com  taxi the night before but it never came and after some anxious 20mins on the main street to hail one, we felt so lucky to get one. We also felt the cleanness could still be improved.","4431":"Central apartment, very close to the city centre.

Avoid Peploe's. Train service just around corner of apartment. Visit Howth which is 30 minutes train ride to stroll along cliffs, beautiful experience.","4436":"Suggest pertinent check-in information to be given ahead of time. I had to call the host from airport and was initially advised to call her back again when we are at apartment. This I found inconvenient as I was already talking to her plus I was concerned that my  international  phone connection might get spotty. She did agree to send me  check-in info then. Host was friendly and responsive; however, guest should not be the one initiating contact.Should have at least 2 set of keys which we have previously requested but told we can keep key in lock box; however I did not find this secure as box is shared with other apartments.

Plenty of room for sleeping and living. Location suited us very well.","4444":"The check-in was very complicated and designed for overseas guests. I understand the need for making sure the tenants are trustworthy but there must be an easier way.","4445":"very quiet","4446":"There was no television. This is something which no accommodation should be without in this day and age.","4447":"Good size house close to the station and bus routes.  2 nice pubs and a restaurant as well as a lidl within a 15 min walk but not much else in the area. Quiet area day and night. All in all ok for what we wanted, which was just a base to travel about from and sleep in at the end of the day.","4448":"House is in need of quite a bit of tlc. When we was there the top floor shower did not work although it could still be used as a bath. No instructions on how to get the hot water working although we worked it out after about 10 mins.","4449":"All cleean and Wondetfull","4450":"The location was ok","4451":"The house was not clean. We met the dishwasher filled with dirty plates. The house heating system wasn't working, I call on different occasions reporting this issue but no help was made.

I will not recommend that property for anyone.","4452":"The bedding was clean.","4453":"The whole property was in a bad state generally. The facilities were poor to meet the needs of our small family. Broken items were left in communal lounges. Bathrooms were not usable due to lack of water coming through either to hot, tap not working or plug to use bath.The photos on website do not reflect the property as some are not even there. It breaches health & safety standards. I will be writing a complaint letter and asking for a refund. Listing all my concerns.

Fortunately the appliances worked as well.","4459":"1. The email instructions I received for entering the property specified the key would be in a locked box. This was not so. The key was under a flower pot. I was not given prior notice about this change. I had to send the host a message and patiently wait for a response. I attempted to call twice and there was no response.  The lock appeared to have been broken in-to. 2. Within a short period of time of entering the property, a real estate agent knocked on the door and pressured us into allowing her to enter for her prospective buyers to view the property. I was not informed the property was for sale or that there would be any viewings during my stay, prior to my arrival. The booking had been arranged at least a week ago. The estate agent claimed not to have been informed about our stay either.3. Prior to arrival, an iron was requested by email. On arrival there was no iron. A subsequent message was sent requesting an iron. I was advised one would be provided. No iron was provided for the duration of the stay and I was forced to purchase one from a shop.4. On the last day, one of the kitchen table chairs broke when my elderly father sat on it, hurting his back.5. The top floor shower did not work. A member of the host's team came to fix and by the evening it stopped working and did not work for the remainder of the stay.6. The middle floor shower was unstable and fell on two family members during use.The only working shower is clearly broken and precariously balanced, falling over from the pressure in the pipe.7. The boiler was not working properly and as such, the shower water was cold. Each family member was forced to have a cold shower. A member of the host's team came to fix and by the evening, it had stopped working properly.8. Only some of the blinds worked.9.

It was close to few good restaurants.( example - The Ivy house)\nEasy to find and not too far from aeroport.\nA lot of shops, supermarkets, restaurants, take away food, around the area.","4490":"Lack of heating. \nThin walls (you could hear everything from the rooms next door)\nLack of connection\/outlets for Europeans","4491":"Everything fine; you get what you pay for.","4492":"Location is good as the bus stop to and from the airport is right outside the property.  Downtown is a short walk away.  I was given a room with a big nice backyard.  Room is clean.","4493":"The only problem, but a very big one, is the very poor quality of wi fi.  I stayed there for four nights.  The wi fi was very poor throughout this period, with numerous disruptions. I eventually gave up. This is unacceptable for a well developed country like Ireland and also one of the most expensive countries in Europe.","4494":"check in. cleanliness.","4495":"roadside is pretty loud and took a night to get used to.","4496":"Excellent location - between the airport and city centre. On main bus route and O' Connell Street is walkable (30-40 mins). Supermarkets and eating places nearby, very convenient. Wasn't sure how to get in at first, but then realised a message was sent via booking.com (instead of email) - apart from this, I actually liked the fact that you just get in using the door code provided and room key already left on the door and no need to interact with anybody, but may be that doesn't appeal to everybody.","4497":"The room I stayed in (no.1) faces the main road and with only single glazed window. For those of you who can't sleep with road noise, you will need ear plugs (it's a main road to the airport). Shower was a bit dodgy - shower head not great, temperature hard to control and bi-folding door somewhat broken, but it served the purpose.","4498":"The apartment was beautiful, really well laid out and in a lovely area. Could not have asked for a better apartment and everything was so smooth. The owner contacted me with all information prior to the stay and went through everything in detail and contacted again after check in to ensure we got there ok and got in ok.","4499":"Nothing, everything was great. Just the cleaners came before check out time and we were in the middle of cooking a fry so didn't get to enjoy our breakfast\/","4500":"Richard was a lovely host. Location was very handy and close to kilmainham gaol.","4501":"The host was fantastic and very responsive to all of our questions! He would answer very quick, and even sent us a short video to explain how to get to the apartment. He was very transparent that there was a small bathroom issue that no one was able to come fix because we were staying during the weekend, but it was no big deal at all, and we appreciated the honesty. Apartment itself was very nice also. Bus stop was not too far away so it was easy to get places. Recommend for friends traveling together or even a family.","4502":"The contact with the owner was very uncomplicated and meeting with him worked perfectly at the agreed time. The apartment is really nice and in a very quiet area, yet not far from the city centre.","4503":"the owner","4504":"everything","4505":"it was spacious and easy to get to!","4506":"the bed was a bit small for a couple other than that everything was great","4507":"location","4508":"the room is very dirty, everything in the bathroom is moldy, there is no hairdryer and hot water, a broken shower, very dirty and worn furniture, garbage from previous guests, a dirty refrigerator, the bed did not look fresh.

Dairy products and fruit was provided for us in the refrigerator. The hosts were courteous and friendly. The size of the room (room no. 2) was perfectly adequate for two people and clean. Stores and bus stations were in the immediate vicinity. With several lines you are in the city center in 15min. At this house you can have the real dublin experience because this is a private room and not a hotel. :)","4546":"Very central yet quiet","4547":"The window above the bedroom door lets in light.

Great view of Dublin over the liffey. Super comfortable and great space for big groups! My family and I had a lovely stay and the staff made sure to go above and beyond to ensure that we were happy. Could not recommend this accommodation more. Great for family's and groups. Look forward to returning.","4564":"The hallway out of it is quite literally the only think I liked. In all seriousness you\u2019d be better off on the streets in regards to cleanliness and cold. Shower and toilet facilities should be bulldozed also.","4565":"Everything about this place was horrible. If it hadn\u2019t of been for the guy who was on the phone, also the same person who showed us to our room, we would have made a U-Turn inside 2 seconds of being in there.

Also you need a printer to get the parking disk and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dated 2019. Would be handy if in the same spot as the keys.

They could inform to present the physical card before constraining people. I was very upset that they didn't inform me. I had to pay again with another card and they refunded me, I understand that all this is for security, but they should inform this detail at the time of booking confirmation.","4612":"Nice manager always willing to help, great neighborhood area in the centre of Dublin","4613":"Bunk beds metal style","4614":"Great location.","4615":"No kitchen facilities.","4616":"It was clean and it\u2019s close to town.","4617":"A but noisy, I could hear people in the other rooms talking and singing.","4618":"Good","4619":"Good","4620":"the staff was great. kitchen was nice.","4621":"breakfast is a bit of a joke. carpets seriously stained. heating broke in winter for a day. they close the common room and kick everyone out at 11pm. bed was bent. really should be cheaper for what you\u2019re getting.","4622":"Great location(close to pubs and attractions)","4623":"Bed,shower,canteen.","4624":"No comment","4625":"Very nice and comfortable appartement.

It was modern, well equipped and warm, with underfloor heating in the games\/drinks room in the basement. Although the bathrooms were shared, they had good shower units and facilities. Bedrooms were generous with double beds and everything was clean and tidy. Only drawback for us was there was only one key for the front door. Could have done with a Yale key as well as front door key and two sets of each. Other than that the communication with the owners was excellent and the location not too far from the centre; about 30 mins to Temple Bar by foot and 10 mins by Uber. There was even a garden that in less wintery weather would just have added to this really smart accommodation. Highly recommended and good value for a group of up to 10 sharing 5 rooms.","4629":"Market Bar overcharged us for a meal which wasn't great although the food was v. good.","4630":"beautiful y renovated property but be aware all beds ( 5 only) are double beds and the sofa bed is actually a recliner","4631":"Booking.com had incorrect information about bed numbers when I booked.

Also, the rug is not very clean and there was something on the head of the bed, some kind of dirt.  There are also other people's socks under the bed and I found a PS4 gamepad there (I left it on the table).  Perhaps a previous visitor forgot it.  Everything else was great. no hair dryer","4668":"Location, space","4669":"Late night outside noise, cold water","4670":"There was a hiccup with the check in where our room was not ready but the host was quick to respond and provided an alternative room.

There was no tea towel or mat to stand on outside the shower. The photo of it's location on the website wasn't where the apartment was.      The apartment was clean enough,mirrors had cracks in and dining chairs were marked. It could do with a deepclean.","4675":"Great location- you're next door to the bars\/ pubs and sightseeing attractions are within walking distance. Apartment was a good size, comfy beds, nice balcony to look over. Host was helpful to sort out an issue with the deposit after the trip.

Would have been nice to have more than one key.","4677":"Apartment was clean and comfortable close to bars and restaurants","4678":"We didnt get the key until 16.20 after many many phone calls which caused us major issues due to us scheduled to pick up match tickets. Very loud music up to 4am and cleaning on the streets started at 5.30am so dont expect much sleep.. it is perfect for a Hen or stag night as location good for all bars and restaurants but thats it.. no shower gel or shampoo supplied and no bottles of water supplied","4679":"No personal contact, keys just locked to bicycle post somewhere on the street...","4680":"excellence at its finest!","4681":"The host was so helpful. Sending videos of check in. Sent bus schedules to help from landing at the airport.\nThe host checks in with you.\nCentral location to everything \nNice apartment","4682":"Not much.","4683":"The unit feels like your borrowing someone's home at a fairly high rental rate.  Too many personal items, poorly equipped kitchen.  The real issue is the poor maintenance.  the unit is unsafe as a rental.  we were locked in a bedroom as the door handle didn't function from the inside.  this unit should not be in a rental pool and I'm disappointed that booking had it on their site","4684":"The number on the door was not displayed, so made it very difficult to find on night of arrival","4685":"Arr\u00eat de bus proche.

The location is not that far from the airport (just ten minutes by taxi), so it was perfect for us because our flight arrived quite late. The neighbourhood is very green and peaceful. From the bigger roads nearby (around ten minutes walking), there are direct bus connections to Dublin's inner city (e.g. O'Connell Street).","4704":"The neighborhood is quiet and the view from the room covers a green front yard and a nearby park. The young couple running the place are very helpful if you need to find your way around Dublin.","4705":"Location is close to the airport with a frequent bus connection that takes just 10 minutes but keep in mind you'll have to walk further 10-15 min. to reach the property (you can walk along the road but if you don't have wheeled luggage I recommend walking through the park, it's very nicely kept).","4706":"The host super friendly, the place clean and with very high standards, the location well connected to the airport as well as to the city","4707":"Notting","4708":"Everything","4709":"Tracey was a great hostess... very kind and friendly. The room was both clean and comfortable. The bed was especially amazing and even better after a long days walk around the city. It is remote and the nearest bus stop is about a 2km walk up the road that can connect you to the city center, but bus schedules can be hit and miss, so be prepared to get a cab as backup. There are a few restaurants just passed the bus stop, not more than a 1hr walk at the most. You can hit the nearest restaurant\/pub in about 20 minutes on foot, or you can have food delivered. All in all, it was a great stay. I would definitely stay here again.","4710":"Breakfast was not included","4711":"It was an old home , a little damp , and the shower was brutal .  It needs a lot of work !","4712":"The ambience and decor.","4713":"No private bathroom.","4714":"The property was beautiful and the owner was very nice and helpful.","4715":"It was in the middle is no where.  It is fine if you have a car without a car you can\u2019t get anywhere to get food.  It would be nice for the owner to have breakfast since it is not close to food.  They might have bikes but I didn\u2019t ask.  Other than that it was fine.  Beautiful old property but keep in mind you are very far from Dublin.","4716":"Lovely hosts! Felt welcome and although the home\/castle is occupied by owners & other guest rooms upstairs..we had lots of autonomy & privacy.location outside of Dublin (southern side so access to eastern shore exploring was good for uskitchen is kitted well with condiments, etcback garden accessed through kitchen is a nice spotclose-ish to Jonny Fox's pubeasy parking","4717":"It's a shared kitchen, which the photos on the listings may lead one to believe that it's joined to one's room..it's adjacent..just 5 steps down the hall.","4718":"Keys were easily handed over. The bedrooms looked nice and the beds were comfy.","4719":"To get there we had to walk 20 minutes on food on the roadside from the nearest bus or tram station. Definitely recommended to arrive by car of you can.  We never met our hosts, except for 2 minutes when the keys were handed over.No stores nearby.","4720":"Spacious double room with ensuite bathroom. We had access to a well equipped kitchen and dining area that is not directly linked to the bedroom but is just 5 footsteps across the hall. We also had sole use of a lovely back garden.  My impression is that this Kitchen and garden may not necessarily be available with this \"double bedroom\" booking depending on whether other people have booked the bedroom that is directly linked to the kitchen and garden on this first floor. Luckily for us that linked room was not booked so we had everything we expected\/hoped. So I would suggest enquiring about these aspects if kitchen use is key to your requirements. Nonetheless there was a fridge\/freezer and kettle in the bedroom itself.\nOne thing that threw our stay was that I thought, from the pictures, that there was a separate living\/dining room\/kitchen where the sofa bed was located but discovered that the sofa bed and double bed are in the same room which was a bit of a disaster for me as I was travelling with Mother who snores loudly!!! This was entirely my own fault for making assumptions.\nJohnny the host and his wife were lively hosts. Johnny was very accommodating with offers of a lift twice to Shankill as my elderly mother and I don't drive. There was a very laid back atmosphere in this family home come hotel cone guest house. You are very much left to your own devices but equally Johnny will thoughtfully check in to see all is ok. A glass of wine on night 1 was a  nice touch.\nLocation and transport wise youll need a car or to pay \u20ac10 to \u20ac13 for a cab to Shankill to then access buses and rail. *I suggest contacting local cab companies directly and NOT usng \"Freenow\"  HORRIFIC lost property experience!*\nThere is a nice pub 20 minutes walk, half on road without path but do-able, called Farmer Browns which served full menu and drinks.","4721":"Communication ahead of the booking could have been better","4722":"Comfortable beds","4723":"The location was a bit far for us but otherwise good.","4724":"Nice and quiet. Comfy bed. Hosts lovely","4725":"I don't think you should be advertising that wifi. I could barely send an email","4726":"The owners were lovely and assisted with transportation issues, as well as recommending some local attractions. The room had its own fridge and we had access to a shared kitchen, which was handy.","4727":"Convenient and centrally placed. Very professional and friendly staff. Loved it!","4728":"close to Center","4729":"no Fridge","4730":"breakfast","4731":"We were supposedly upgraded from Barry's to the Belvedere.  Only problem was no wardrobe or coat hangers in room.  Ask at reception but was told that they didnt have any. If this was an upgrade not sure what would have been awaiting us at Barry's hotel.","4732":"No place or way of hanging clothes.","4733":"Location. Close to main attractions.","4734":"breakfast was really good, helpful staff, great location","4735":"Breakfast was great! Food really fresh and great variety of cereal and bread. Yogurt, ham and cheese very good too. Amazing coffee!","4736":"Retro style of bedroom ( Very Micheal Collins! )Comfy bed ,Very helpful and friendly staff.","4737":"Room very hot . I couldn't control temp as adjuster on radiator was broken off.","4738":"Breakfast was fine.","4739":"Room was very small. Windows couldn't open. Toilet was placed next to the shower, with very little space, actually less  space than in a flight seat.","4740":"great breakfast and convenient to places!","4741":"The flat was absolutely perfect. Spotlessly clean, really comfy bed, lovely and warm and very easy to get access. \nLocation was great and only \u20ac22 for a taxi into centre of Dublin. Also very handy for ppl who need to get to and from the airport.","4742":"There are many known symbols of Ireland. Harp, Clover, Beer, etc.I think, for today, these were expanded by Alan's smiley, helpfulness, and flexibility! Alan for Tourism President! or at least a national treasure.","4743":"it was everything we needed and more!","4744":"very easy check in, responsive host and lovely flat. location good too","4745":"nothing","4746":"The apartment was very comfortable and spacious.  The location was very convenient to the airport.  THe host was very accomodating and gave great recommendations for dining and other requests.","4747":"Exceptionally clean and comfortable, Alan was very helpful.","4748":"Alan was a gentleman, met us on arrival with a big smile on his face, gave us a quick tour and let us be. This property goes above and beyond, satellite TV, Netflix, enough fresh towels for full family, Alan even stocked the fridge with bottled water and milk and supplied tea and biscuits, lovely touches. Alan also recommended an Italian restaurant 2 mins from the flat which was belissimo. 20 mins from City Centre during off peak traffic times, very decent location.","4749":"honestly, can\u2019t fault this place","4750":"The apartment is a close drive to the airport and was easy for out early morning flight. \nIt was also very clean and comfortable. would definitely recommend staying here.","4751":"Close from the airport, very cleaned. quiet neighbourhood. very nice owner always here to help.","4752":"the sofa in the leaving wasn\u2019t too confortable but ok for a few nights","4753":"\u0417\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0448\u043d\u043e \u0456 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e","4754":"","4755":"\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u043b\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e.","4756":"","4757":"It had lots of amenities such as hair dryer and iron etc. There was also lots of shampoo and other bathroom products which came in handy as we packed lightly.","4758":"It was not particularly clean but I think this was only apparent because it is a little run down. It was not all that close to the city centre but still a walkable distance. The host was very blunt, borderline rude. They originally agreed to a check-in from 11am-12pm (our flight arrived at 9am) but this was then revised to 12pm earliest (which I completely understood as previous guests had supposedly left a mess) before being changed to 2pm finally. When I questioned this I was told that standard check-in time was 2pm anyway if I had read the booking details. When we were settled in I was sent a notification of a deposit fee. I completely understand that this is standard practice but as it has not been mentioned before and it was to be sent by PayPal I did think it came across a bit sketchy.","4759":"property location is very good, everything is around you","4760":"No complaints","4761":"No blankets 4 bed bed not even made up, tried charge more money next day after we left gave no reason","4762":"Es ist eine Wohnung.","4763":"","4764":"Hat gar nichts mit Luxury zu tun. Einfach nur eine durchschnittliche Wohnung. Als Schweizer Handwerker stellen sich mir da die Nackenhaare auf. Die vorgefundenen langen Haare waren nicht von uns. Oberfl\u00e4chlich sauber, aber weiter sollte man nicht schauen. Heizung im Wohnzimmer ist ein dahin gestellter Elektroofen, das andere fest verbaute Ger\u00e4t heizt gar nicht. F\u00fcr Warmwasser zum Duschen muss man vorher eine komische Steuerung bet\u00e4tigen, damit der Warmwasserboiler geladen wird, dann f\u00e4ngt es an zu pl\u00e4tschern im Boiler.

Overall, a good stay","4770":"There was some trash in the apartment from previous rents.","4771":"Location is great and close to public transportation.","4772":"The property is rather old.  The door is rather flimsy and I feel it can be easily broken into.  The lock is just a simple lock and could easily be jammed open with a piece of metal slip between the crack.  The shower area and one of the sink could be cleaner and the drain wasn't really working that well and pluged up a bit.   Quality of the furniture is rather old and one had a broken leg.  The windows are old and some of the latches almost fell off the hinges.  I don't think they put any investment to upgrade the property.  Even the person who checked us in admitted the property is dated and could be freshen up - Geez.","4773":"A nice apartment in the city center of Dublin, with a good distance from the Temple Bar, Trinity College, etc.The apartment has a modern design wiith two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a living room with a sofa bed. The kitchen has a nespresso machine, kettle, tostadora etc. and all you need. There is a SPAR store quite near. It's not a big one, but you find the most important things you need for preparing a meal. The heating, wifi, etc. worked properly. And Jacob was really kind and let us to leave the luggage and make the check out two hours later. Thank you very much for that!","4774":"Two things: we found a bathroom not cleaned. When we went to use the toilet in the bathroom of the double room we saw that it had been used and the chain had not even been thrown away. It was a bad surprise. I think the cleaning team that manages the apartment is not very good. On the other hand, I think that details are missing to make the apartment really comfortable (for example, putting a shelf in the showers to leave the gel) and also, one of the rooms has the bed placed in such a way that it does not allow to pass. This room is quite unconfortable.","4775":"Good location. Good size.

Complete with parking space. Easy to commute Dublin via public transport. Local amenities very good.  Good choice of restaurants","4786":"The boiler was very noisy","4787":"Boden Heath is a self catering apartment on the south suburbs of Dublin. It was easy to locate, and the owner gave full and detailed instructions on how to access the (secure) property.  I felt we got what we paid for. The apartment was comfortable, and though not 'de-luxe' it had everything one might need for a comfortable lodging, including full wi-fi. There is a modern clean lift to the upper floors of the block. We had one or two queries which the owner was very quick to answer, and he even came round to put a slight hiccup right. He couldn't have been more helpful. The flat is around 30 minutes drive from the city centre with all the tourist attractions that make Dublin such a special place and there are numerous bus stops handy with frequent services into town. There are numerous shops, supermarkets and restaurants within easy reach.","4788":"The decor needs a bit of a spruce-up but that said there is nothing wrong that impinges on one's comfort, so there really wasn't anything to say I \"didn't like\" about it. I would have no hesitation in recommending this flat as a comfortable place to stay, and as the boiler cracks and bangs its way into service, it's even quite \"exciting\"!   LOL!","4789":"Michael was very welcoming and easy to talk to.

Window has a very thin curtain that people could possibly see us through from other property.  - We woke up at the middle of the night due to the noise from people coming in. - WiFi unpredictable","4819":"location was great, short distance walk from a lovely little playground which was great for our little one","4820":"would have liked if there was a toaster. jacuzzi was difficult to understand but i would recommend asking the owner for help with it before :)","4821":"There was no breakfast, but the location was very central. They added nice touches like a bottle of wine in the fridge.","4822":"It was much worse than I expected. Yes the location was very central, but the room was in very poor condition. There were plates, cups, bowls and cutlery all in very good condition. But they should have focused much more on the condition of the flat. It was mostly covered with a very old patchy fitted carpet. The cooker was decades old. The flimsy little curtain over the kitchen sink fell off the wall when I tried to close it the first night. I later went and bought some glue to stick it back on. In any case even closed it really blocked very little light, so when the sun rose very early on the summer mornings the light was immediately brightening up the room. The price was absurdly high for this small run down little space.  Maybe the jacuzzi's great, I wasn't interested in using a jacuzzi but unless you are just enthralled by jacuzzies I don't think that would go very far to make up for all of the other many serious shortcomings.","4823":"The location was decent.","4824":"The bathroom had a sewage smell. The beds were uncomfortable. While he was initially helpful by sending a cleaner, the host became hostile when I requested a refund for the unsanitary sewage smell in the bathroom, which made it very uncomfortable.","4825":"Smell Of rubbish around apartment and smell out of fridge","4826":"Ingenting.

Also few electrical issues with lightbulbs didn't function and toaster tripped the mains. Initial communications with owner were good at first, but during the stay when we had a problem, I got no response. Without these extra comforts, it wasn't value for money (despite booking in high season).","4897":"The location suited us very well. It was central for most places, and a short taxi drive from others. The hosts were very pleasant, and very helpful. The apartment had good space and facilities, and accommodated 2 couples very comfortably. It was well-lit and heated, WiFI good and the kitchen was serviceable. Washing machine also very handy. When I asked for a fan (for hot flushes), there was one beside the bed when we arrived. Laura responded almost immediately when I had a problem or needed something.","4898":"The mattresses are not the most comfortable - a little thin. A change of linen would only be provided at a cost of (as I remember) 40 Euro. It may be less, so I stand to be corrected. But it was of an amount enough to buy an extra set of linen myself. This seemed a little unreasonable, but they did say laundry costs are high. If we'd had an extra set, we could have laundered and dried them ourselves.  Instead of chewing up electricity to dry them before bed-time.It would be helpful  to have some instructions for the microwave, oven etc.  There were a couple of things missing (bedside lights, not enough waste bins), but these are all relatively small issues.

We had issues with no directions for things, like the hot water or washer dryer.  We found written directions on day five behind the cutting boards for the hot water.  The plugs did not work when we arrived, had to reset the breakers. A folder with some information about how to work those things would have saved a lot of frustration.  The US does not commonly have washer\/dryer combos, so that was a challenge.","5070":"Easy self check in and outGreat location, luas next door (doesn't run all night), Guinness is just a few mins away, city  centre 30 mins walking, Lidl 8 mins walking Well equipped, everything needed is there (there is a blow dryer so don't bring one ;) and a washing machine, dish washer)Nice view from balcony!

Very friendly owner, he gave us everything we needed for our trip. We had no problem during the check-in and check out. Be careful by planning your trip; the streets and roads are narrow, the average speed is very low.You can use the highway, the highway feels already included in the price. The quality of roads are very good. It is allowed to stay overnight on the way.","5161":"There is a heavy problem to find a place for overnight staying at some areas, mainly outside of parks.It is recommended to Plan  your trip in advance.","5162":"Friendly service, available at the times described for pick-up\/drop-off. Deposit returned quickly. Renting a camper allowed us to travel around Ireland and see a lot more on a budget.","5163":"Specifically Van #1 Scooby: The driver\u2019s seat is unable to adjust as the kitchen cabinet is fixed in place behind it - if you\u2019re tall you will not have a comfortable drive. Combine that with the fact that these vans are indeed retro (30+ years old) and require some manual use of the clutch - you have a tricky drive. \nThe ad says that it sleeps 4, if you look at the photos you\u2019d soon see that\u2019s an overstatement. The pop-up tent was old, worn & torn so putting someone (a child\/children due to the size) up on that platform would make me feel terrible! It would be cold and damp. \nWe didn\u2019t use the fridge as we were afraid of running the van battery flat and being stuck somewhere at our own expense. So to use that\/other electrics\/heating you need to be at a campsite. We chose to free camp and go without these items.\nNo TV in the van (not an issue for us, just not as described). \nThe descriptions just seem to be a bit ambitious for what is actually provided - so inspect the photos and be a bit pragmatic.","5164":"My Mum and I were renting one camper because of the Garth Concert. Compared to available Hotel rooms the camper was really affordable so we gave it a shot.First impression was mixed, we didnt know what we had to expect. When the owner arrived, I was glad and happy. He is competent and could anwer all questions I had. Very good feeling afterwards.Due to the concert and all the visitors we weren\u00b4t able to find a suitable camping site so we just stood nearby the croke park, that was not exactly good for comfort but perfect for what we needed.When renting a van, don\u00b4t forget to think of camping sites you want to stay, because there you will have heating, sanataries and electricity. All in all it was a great and different experience and for 2 persons it was perfectly fine. But don\u00b4t forget to think that they are vintage cars, no high end luxury.","5165":"The renting site is quite far from the airport, so we had to pay taxi to get us there, maybe it is possible for the owner to get a transport for the guests.On the other hand there is supposed to be a train station nearby so you could reach it with public transport.","5166":"We loved travelling in a camper van and seeing Ireland at our leisure. The camper van was older, but comfortable and had all basic amenities. Good value for money compared to other offerings in Ireland. The engine was strong and kept going. Inconsiderate renters caused us to get another camper van than what was originally booked, but Darren was always available for questions and to resolve any issue we had.","5167":"We had here 3 nights and enjoyed this vacation very well. The owner helped us with all we needed. We traveled across the country and it is really amazing and also people there. Parking with van is also very easy. There is a lot of places where you can park for free and have a nice view at the morning.","5168":"First day unfortunately with first van we get broken engine on the highway in late evening so we were stucked there for a couple of hours. The owner helped us with bringing the second van almost in midnight, unfortunately we were 5 people and second van was just for 4 people. So sleeping was little complicated, but we could continue our vacation. Unfortunately second van had broken battery, so every morning we couldn't start, fortunately the Irish people are awesome and helped us out.","5169":"-Cool modern camper with all needed amenities and supplies to keep you going- Customer service was great. Really quick replies to all questions-Lovely vintage vibe-Freedom of parking where ever you'd like","5170":"- No written guide or instructions on how to use equipment","5171":"The staff is very helpful and very communicative. We spent 4 days with the the van travelling around Dublin and Galway and the space is more than enough for two people. The van has everything that you need.","5172":"The up bed wasn't very comfortable. No heating and  at night it was a bit cold (March). Better bring very warm clothes and a sleeping bag to sleep.","5173":"Great opportunity for alternative stay in Ireland. We rented Bandit and enjoyed it well. Old style driving with 30+ years car made me remember my first, but everything worked without any problem. Friendly staff with their own service garage. You can get there by Luas tram from central Dublin (red line to Kylemore stop and then approx. 1km walk). Local roads in Ireland are narrow and it's not always easy to find parking, so we planned spots ahead and it paid off.","5174":"The Bandit has a 2L petrol engine, so you have to take into account the corresponding consumption.","5175":"Retro Camper Van is the BEST way to see Ireland - plentiful car parks, kind people, come and go as you please. The staff was communicative, and accommodating. Easy to find, pickup and dropoff was a breeze. Plus, how cool is it to roll around the coast in a vintage van? Can't wait to come back!","5176":"I'm tall so the beds were a tad short for my liking. My wife was fine though. Other than that no issues whatsoever! No mechanical issues. One of the cabinets kept opening when going over bumps but this did not affect performance of the vehicle at all.","5177":"Well equipped mini kitchen with full fridge freezer,microwave etc. Tea, coffee and milk was supplied.","5178":"This is a single room with 3 beds, the photos were slightly misleading to me, I thought there were 2 separate rooms. All of the furniture is tatty and basic. The bathroom smells a bit mouldy and the shower controls are completely battered and need replacing. Couldn't turn the bathroom light off and this means you can't get total darkness at night. No TV. The host was friendly enough but he turned up to drop off a tumble drying during our stay which was an unwelcome disturbance. The area is nice enough, few shops and restaurants about. Taxi ride into Temple Bar took around 10 minutes. Walking was more like 30 minutes.","5179":"Good location with plenty of restaurants and supermarkets nearby.","5180":"The place didn\u00b4t look clean at all, we woke up many times because we had ants in our beds. The bathroom\u00b4s light couldn\u00b4t be switched off which was very annoying at night. But the worst part was the host\u00b4s kind of threatening behaviour. The description said that towels were included but the ones they had left in our beds were damp and there weren\u00b4t any hand towels in the kitchen or the bathroom either so we opened the cupboards and got some dry towels. The next day after we had already checked out, the property\u00b4s owner texted us to say that he was very disappointed because we had used more towels, as the conditions of the property stated that we were not allowed to use them. He also said he might have to charge us 20E extra for this. We looked at the description and it obviously didn\u00b4t mention anything about this, he was just trying to overcharge us for his stupid things. I would absolutely avoid this place unless you want to get scammed.","5181":"The location was a little over 1 mile from the city center.","5182":"The floors were very dirty and ants were crawling all over the floors. The bathroom light did not turn off. The curtain had explicit writing on it. It smelled like smoke. The shower had hairs in it.","5183":"The kitchen was fully equipped","5184":"- the toilet was broken and was flushing CONTINUOUSLY for the duration of my stay\n- the toilet has a glass door and there was no way to turn the bathroom light off. In a studio this gets annoying.\n- the above points were raised with the owner who did not really care, saying they would have sent someone the day after my departure \n- towels and sheets were a bit smelly\n- overall cleanliness was way below average","5185":"Proximity to Dublin centre, having a kitchen to make meals, free wifi.","5186":"Broken fixtures, ants in kitchen, worn furniture, no air conditioning, and no TV.","5187":"A Dublin, et en Irlande de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les prix sont exorbitants pour les services propos\u00e9s. Ce logement n'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas bien not\u00e9 mais nous n'avions pas le choix, et les remarques des autres voyageurs n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues par le propri\u00e9taire. Pas s\u00fbre des 40 m\u00e8tres carr\u00e9s. Mauvaise isolation pour un logement en bord de route. Dans la salle de bain, porte et robinet de la douche cass\u00e9s, toilettes qui fuient, tr\u00e8s g\u00eanant quand on doit laisser la porte ouverte car il faut trop chaud dans l'appartement. T\u00e2ches au bas de la douche et \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re des toilettes, et sol gras. Dans la pi\u00e8ce principale, des armoires mais impossible de ranger ses affaires car les \u00e9tag\u00e8res sont encombr\u00e9es par la r\u00e9serve. Les valises doivent donc rester au sol et encombrent. Certes 3 jeux d'\u00e9tag\u00e8res en plus dans la  pi\u00e8ces principale mais elles aussi en partie encombr\u00e9s et si prennent \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de place, tout comme le deuxi\u00e8me lave-linge (???). Le micro-ondes fonctionne mal. La lumi\u00e8re de la salle de bain ne s'\u00e9teint que par le disjoncteur au-dessus d'un des petits lits, peu pratique puisque la porte est vitr\u00e9e comme la porte d'entr\u00e9e dont le store occultant est cass\u00e9. Le lit 140 est inconfortable car on sent les ressorts. Pour le prix on attend mieux.","5188":"","5189":"L'appartement \u00e9tait sale, pleins de fourmis dans la cuisine. La lumi\u00e8re de la salle de bain ne s'\u00e9teint pas m\u00eame la nuit, elle est d\u00e9rangeante pour dormir. Les matelas des lits ne sont pas confortables et font tr\u00e8s mals au dos. La chaleur de la douche ne peut pas se r\u00e9gler, de plus l'eau ne s'\u00e9vacue pas. La vaisselle \u00e9tait sale nous avons du tout relaver.","5190":"","5191":"There are no comments available for this review","5192":"There are no comments available for this review","5193":"There are no comments available for this review","5194":"The apartment is nice but tiny.  Defrost the freezer please and deep clean the bathroom tiles.","5195":"The apartment faces on to Patrick Street and its traffic and sirens 24 hours a day.  It is not a safe location. Junkies, alcoholics everywhere, often sitting outside the apartment until 3am singing, shouting and fighting.","5196":"Location was excellent","5197":"For 4 person there are only 3 forks","5198":"Amazing property, fantastic facilities and really clean","5199":"The property was very cozy, quiet, spacious, and well equipped. It was located only a few minutes from the train station, in a quiet neighborhood.","5200":"The tool shed outside the house was in a pretty rough state, it would look much better if closed at all times. When it comes to property the tap in the kitchen was dripping, which was quite irritating.","5201":"Beautiful house and great location by the train station","5202":"Watered down soap in the bathroom","5203":"It is located in a nice quiet suburb, and noises from the neighbouring rooms didn't disturb my sleep, either. The window blinds allow sleeping in real darkness (not universal in Ireland). The beds were comfortable and long enough for me.We took the whole apartment (all three bedrooms) as a family, so I can't report on sharing the common rooms with strangers; but the common rooms were spacious, the fridge and the kitchen furniture were large enough for five persons, and a door separates the common rooms from the aisle to the bedrooms. There is just one bathroom but that caused no problems in the end. Heating was functional (not universal in Ireland). Wildlife (including foxes) visits the garden.The train station (with at least three trains an hour per direction), a bus stop, a supermarket, and multiple takeaways and restaurants are within a 5 minute walk, it was really easy to get around by public transport resp. get supplies & food.The hosts, though you never meet them in the flesh, respond promptly to email requests.","5204":"The on-line check-in is cumbersome and confusing, especially when you use a non-touchscreen computer\/notebook (the passport scan upload page even had a glitch where you had to step back and forward again for it to load instead of a page meant for phones with cameras).There are no electrical sockets in the bathroom (this seems to be not by design choice but mandated by UK\/Ireland regulations) and no mirrors near sockets elsewhere. The hairdryer had a defective plug that overheated quickly, handle with care.Hot water pressure was too low, but this was similar for all places we stayed at in Ireland.Almost twice as much expensive as hotels of similar or higher comfort we stayed at elsewhere in Ireland, but it's Dublin.","5205":"There were 6 guests but only 5 mugs and no cups. The kitchen was also lacking a couple of utensils (no frying pan)","5206":"great location very clean and very comfortable beds lovely garden view and peaceful","5207":"the only thing it was lacking a couple of basics like tea towels","5208":"Location was brilliant. Off street parking & the property was just the right size","5209":"Dripping tap!!","5210":"Location was excellent. The house good and beds very comfortable. James. who came to cut the grass, was really nice and helpful. The Dart railway station and supermarket are easily within walking distance.","5211":"The kitchen tap dripped and an extra toilet would have been handy. There was no bath mat to step onto when coming out of the shower so had to use a towel. We just about managed to get the TV to work but James told us they are waiting for a satalite dish to be conected. Just a little TLC needed but on the whole very satisfied with the stay.","5212":"Absolutely amazing staying here, lovely property and location","5213":"nothing it was perfect","5214":"The location is really nice and Dublin can be reached by train easily.","5215":"Well, you can see that it has been used extensively. The furniture etc. has pasted its best years. The water tap in the kitchen was dripping heavily although it was turned off.  The mattresses were very soft and you are sinking into it.","5216":"close to the centre","5217":"The TV wouldn\u2019t come on, had a lot of messing round to get it working. The wifi again wasn\u2019t working and there was a few different passwords around the living room","5218":"The location of the apartment was great, a close walk across the river to the city center. The check in instructions were detailed and helpful. The unit was spacious. Lots great coffee shops near by.","5219":"The contact for the unit isn\u2019t the owner, it\u2019s a manager. They were responsive during the day, but not on the weekends or after hours. The keys for the unit are in a key locker about a 15 minute walk away that you are required to pick up from and drop off to. This is quite burdensome with luggage. Our keys were not in the key box when we arrived, but they were dropped off 30 minutes after we got in touch with the manager. The bathroom has some water damage and there was some mold in the shower. The couches are worn, loosing their shape, and starting to fray.","5220":"Location, facilities,  great apartment  with everything you need.","5221":"Could do with new carpets.","5222":"V good location, clean, comfortable + warm. TV services very good. Nice 70s-80s furnishings and services -suited us. Would certainly stay there again because of price and location.","5223":"Key pick up was irritating, although contact was very helpful and managed to eventually got us sorted","5224":"Cosy and quiet apartment with a nice kitchen. Friendly stuff. Close to the Convention Centre. Would definately come back when I have a conference there.","5225":"Gate key stopped working one day. Issue was professionally handled, though. Key pick-up is 15 minutes by foot, luckily easy to access with tram.","5226":"fantastic location. \ngreat space.","5227":"location for picking up keys is 20 minutes away from the apartment. not great when you have luggage. \nseveral pieces of furniture in the apartment were almost at the point of being broken and could do with replacing. \nonly 2 very small, thin towels provided which were not adequate.","5228":"comfortable \u2018home from home\u2019 feel\nexcellent communication with \nchecking details, advice re parking","5229":"hairs in bath plug, stopped water\ndraining properly \nfrozen meat in freezer\nhadn\u2019t been told re button for hot\nwater so cold shower one evening \nonce we found it all was great.","5230":"I really liked the central location. Perfect to get to everywhere we needed and quiet.","5231":"The bed was a little lumpy and creaky. But could easily overlook that because the rest of it was so good.","5232":"Renata was brilliant- very helpful, friendly and informative Great checking In\/ out instructions","5233":"Keys weren\u2019t in the handiest location","5234":"Very clean super easy to get to places very well located","5235":"Estaba limpio, la calefacci\u00f3n funcionaba bien, muchos productos de limpieza","5236":"","5237":"Sartenes rayadisimas, abolladas hasta el punto de no poder casi cocinar y tener que comerte el tefl\u00f3n levantado.

Very helpful and friendly host. Apartment was spotless, cosy and full of everything you need.","5240":"There were no complaints about this property.","5241":"Really nice, spacious feeling in the property, beautiful view. It's in the city centre, so it can get noizy - but that's what I expected anyway, and me personally I don't mind. Great communication with the owner and his team. In the apartment lots of thoughtful little touches, as fresh milk prepared and bread, plenty of shower gels and shampoos. I can definitely recommend and hopefully I ll have a chance to visit again.","5242":"+\nLarge apartment!\nNice shower!\nplenty of shampoos, conditioners, etc.\nespresso machine (and pods provided)!\nheating on at the arrival (upon request)\nbut even without heating the apartment is quite warm and well insulated\nice trays in the freezer (upon request)!\ngood quality appliances !\nthe view!\nthe light! oh, the light\u2026\nthe owner and assistant were polite and ready to answer our requests. thanks!","5243":"-\neverything I did not like is not a responsibility of the owner. it is not their fault if\nin the streets there are people shouting during the night\u2026. it\u2019s Dublin\nthe price of the apartment is relatively high\u2026 it\u2019s Dublin\nthe entrance initially disappointed us because we thought we were in a designer place, but again it is not the fault of the owner, who really went the extra mile to make the apartment super cool and our stay as great as possible","5244":"tolle Lage und Ausstattung.
